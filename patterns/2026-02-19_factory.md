## Pattern Analysis

### Analysis of Factory Pattern in `factory.py`

**Pattern Used:** Factory

The factory pattern is implemented through the `create_app` function, which acts as a factory method for creating an instance of the `FastAPI` application.

- **Implementation**: The `create_app` function initializes and configures the FastAPI app by setting its properties, middleware, exception handlers, and routers. It also handles startup and shutdown via the `lifespan` context manager.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Decoupling**: The factory method decouples the application creation process from the specific environment (development vs production) settings.
  - **Flexibility**: Allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the core application code.

- **Deviations**:
  - The `lifespan` context manager is used to manage startup and shutdown, which is a deviation from the typical factory pattern that focuses on object creation. Here, it's more about managing lifecycle events.
  
- **Appropriateness**:
  - This pattern is appropriate for initializing complex applications with multiple configurations and dependencies. It ensures that all necessary components are set up correctly before the application starts.

In summary, while not strictly adhering to the traditional factory pattern, this implementation effectively encapsulates the application setup process, making it easier to manage and configure different environments.
