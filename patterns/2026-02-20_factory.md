## Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Analysis

**Pattern Used:** Factory Method

In the provided code, the `create_app` function acts as a factory method to create an application instance. This is evident in how `app = create_app()` initializes the application object.

**Implementation:**
- The `create_app` function (not shown) likely contains logic to instantiate and configure the application based on settings or other conditions.
- It returns an instance of the application, which is then assigned to the global variable `app`.

**Benefits:**
- **Flexibility:** Allows for different types of applications to be created depending on runtime conditions or configuration.
- **Decoupling:** The code that uses `app` does not need to know how it was created, promoting loose coupling.

**Deviations from Standard Pattern:**
- Typically, the factory method pattern involves a more complex setup where multiple products can be created. Here, only one product (the application) is being created.
- The implementation details of `create_app` are not shown, but in a typical factory method, there might be different methods to create different types of applications.

**Appropriateness:**
- This pattern is appropriate when the application needs to be configured differently based on external factors or settings. It abstracts the creation process and allows for easy extension if new types of applications need to be supported in the future.
- However, if only one type of application is needed consistently, this might overcomplicate the code.

This factory method pattern ensures that the `app` object can be created flexibly while keeping the main script simple.
