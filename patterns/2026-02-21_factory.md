## Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Analysis

**Pattern Used:** Factory Method

The `create_app` function in the provided code implements a **Factory Method** design pattern. This method is used to encapsulate object creation logic, allowing for flexible instantiation of objects based on specific conditions or configurations.

#### Implementation
- The `create_app` function from the `factory` module is called and assigned to the global variable `app`. This function likely returns an instance of a FastAPI application configured according to settings.
  
```python
app = create_app()
```

#### Benefits
1. **Flexibility:** By using `create_app`, the code can easily switch between different configurations or types of applications without modifying the main entry point.
2. **Decoupling:** The creation logic is separated from the usage, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

#### Deviations
- There are no explicit deviations from the canonical Factory Method pattern in this snippet. However, it's worth noting that `create_app` could be further abstracted or extended with additional parameters for more complex scenarios.

#### Appropriate Use Cases
This pattern is appropriate when:
1. You need to create objects based on configuration or external conditions.
2. The creation logic should not be hardcoded in the main application code, promoting better separation of concerns and modularity.

In this context, using `create_app` ensures that the FastAPI application can be configured dynamically without cluttering the entry point with complex initialization logic.
