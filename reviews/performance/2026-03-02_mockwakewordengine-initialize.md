```typescript
async initialize(): Promise<void> {
		logger.wake.log("Using keyboard trigger (Ctrl+Shift+A)");

		this.handler = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
			if (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.key === "A") {
				e.preventDefault();
				logger.wake.log("Manual trigger via Ctrl+Shift+A");
				this.onWakeWord?.();
			}
		};

		window.addEventListener("keydown", this.handler);
	}

## Performance Analysis

### Performance Analysis

**Time Complexity:** The function has a time complexity of \(O(1)\), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) since no additional data structures are created that grow with the input size. However, there is an event listener being added to `window`, which could potentially impact memory if not cleaned up properly.

**Bottlenecks or Inefficiencies:**
- **Blocking Calls:** The function uses async/await syntax but does not perform any asynchronous operations inside it. This means that the function itself is not inherently blocking, but adding an event listener can block other events from being processed until the handler is removed.
- **Redundant Operations:** The `logger.wake.log` calls are redundant if they log the same message every time the function runs.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Remove or consolidate logging statements to avoid unnecessary output. If these logs are only for debugging, consider wrapping them in a conditional check based on an environment variable.
- Ensure that the event listener is properly removed when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks and improve performance.

**Resource Usage Concerns:**
- **Event Listener:** Make sure to remove the event listener when the `WakeWordEngine` instance is destroyed or replaced. This can be done using a cleanup function in an `onDestroy` method if such a lifecycle method exists.
  
By addressing these points, you can improve both the readability and maintainability of your code while ensuring it doesn't introduce unnecessary performance overhead.
