## Source Code

```python
def validate_password_strength(cls, v: str) -> str:
        """
        Ensure password has minimum complexity
        """
        if not any(c.isupper() for c in v):
            raise ValueError(
                "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
            )
        if not any(c.isdigit() for c in v):
            raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one digit")
        return v
```

## Performance Analysis

### Performance Analysis

#### Time Complexity
The function has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the password string `v`. This is because it iterates over each character in the string to check for uppercase letters and digits.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since no additional data structures are used that scale with input size. Only a few variables (`c`) are used, which consume constant space.

#### Bottlenecks or Inefficiencies
- **Redundant Iteration**: The function iterates over the string twice (once for checking uppercase letters and once for digits). This can be optimized by combining both checks into one iteration.
  
#### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Combine Checks**:
   ```python
   def validate_password_strength(cls, v: str) -> str:
       if not any(c.isupper() or c.isdigit() for c in v):
           raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter and one digit")
       return v
   ```
   This reduces the number of iterations from two to one.

2. **Type Hints and Class Context**:
   Ensure that `cls` is properly defined as a class method or function, and use type hints for better readability and maintainability.

#### Resource Usage Concerns
- No resource leaks are present in this code snippet.
- The function does not allocate any significant resources like file handles or database connections.

By combining the checks into one iteration, you improve both time efficiency and readability.
