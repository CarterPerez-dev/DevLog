## File Overview

# routers.tsx Documentation

## Purpose and Responsibility
This file defines the routing configuration for a full-stack application, ensuring that different pages are accessible based on user roles and permissions.

## Key Exports or Public Interface
- `router`: A `createBrowserRouter` instance configured with routes.
  
## How It Fits in the Project
The `routers.tsx` file is central to the project's navigation system. It imports various components and lazy-loaded pages, setting up protected routes for different user roles (e.g., admin). The routing configuration ensures that users are directed to appropriate pages based on their role or if they are unauthorized.

## Notable Design Decisions
- **Lazy Loading**: Routes are lazily loaded using `import()`, which improves initial load time and performance.
- **Protected Routes**: Utilizes a custom `ProtectedRoute` component to enforce access control, ensuring that only authorized users can navigate certain paths.
- **Shell Component**: A common layout component (`<Shell />`) is used as the base for protected routes, providing a consistent UI structure across different pages.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles (e.g., `UserRole.ADMIN`) are checked to determine access to admin-specific routes.
```

This documentation provides an overview of the file's role in the project, its key exports, and notable design decisions.
