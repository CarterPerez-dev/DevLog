## File Overview

### Enums for Stripe Referral Configuration

**Purpose:**
This file defines various enums used throughout the `stripe-referral` application to ensure consistency, type safety, and clarity in configuration settings.

**Key Exports:**
- **PayoutStatus**: Enum for different payout statuses.
- **ReferralCodeStatus**: Enum for referral code statuses.
- **ReferralTrackingStatus**: Enum for tracking status of referrals.
- **AdapterType**: Enum for types of payout adapters.
- **RewardType**: Enum for different reward types in referral programs.
- **CurrencyCode**: Enum representing supported currency codes.
- **Environment**: Enum for application environments.
- **LogLevel**: Enum for logging levels.

**Project Fit:**
This file is part of the `stripe-referral` project, providing essential configuration constants that are used across multiple modules. These enums help maintain consistency and provide a clear interface for handling various states and types in the system.

**Design Decisions:**
- **Type Hints**: All enums inherit from `str` and `Enum`, ensuring type safety.
- **Consistency**: Using enums ensures consistent usage of values throughout the application, reducing errors related to magic strings.
- **Extensibility**: Enums can be easily extended or modified if new statuses or types are needed without changing existing code.
```

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the file's purpose, key exports, and how it fits into the larger project. It also highlights notable design decisions that contribute to the overall maintainability and robustness of the application.
