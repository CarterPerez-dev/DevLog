## File Overview

### settings.py

**Purpose and Responsibility:**
This file defines a comprehensive set of configuration constants for various aspects of the CertGames-Core application, including business rules, limits, and milestones.

**Key Exports or Public Interface:**
- `Settings.Business`: A nested class containing static final attributes representing key business rules and constants. These include question limits, message lengths, coin rewards, streak milestones, and more.

**How it Fits in the Project:**
`settings.py` serves as a central configuration hub for the application. It provides a structured way to manage and access critical settings across different modules, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. The `Settings.Business` class encapsulates domain-specific rules, making them easily accessible throughout the codebase.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Static Final Attributes:** All attributes are defined as `Final` constants with type hints for clarity and immutability.
- **Nested Class Structure:** Using a nested `Business` class to organize related settings, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Type Hints and Annotations:** Extensive use of type hints and annotations (e.g., `Final`, `Any`) to ensure correctness and provide clear documentation within the code itself.

This file is crucial for maintaining the application's configuration and ensures that all business rules are consistently applied across different components.
