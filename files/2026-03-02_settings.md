## File Overview

# settings.py Documentation

## Purpose and Responsibility
This file defines a comprehensive set of configuration constants for various aspects of the CertGames-Core backend, including business rules, limits, and milestones.

## Key Exports and Public Interface
- **Settings.Business**: A nested class containing all business-related constants such as question limits, message lengths, rewards, and more.

## How It Fits in the Project
The `settings.py` file serves as a central hub for configuration settings. These settings are used across multiple modules to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance. The constants defined here influence various functionalities like user interactions, leaderboard updates, and reward systems.

## Notable Design Decisions
- **Use of Final**: All constants are marked with `Final` to prevent accidental modification.
- **Nested Classes**: Using a nested class (`Settings.Business`) for organizing related settings improves readability and maintainability.
- **Type Hints**: Type hints (e.g., `Final`, `Any`) ensure type safety and provide clear documentation within the code itself.

This file is crucial for maintaining the project's configuration and ensuring that all components adhere to predefined rules and limits.
