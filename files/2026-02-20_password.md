## File Overview

### password.py

**Purpose & Responsibility:**
This Python file provides utilities for password hashing, validation, and token generation. It ensures secure password handling by using bcrypt for hashing and implementing robust validation rules.

**Key Exports & Public Interface:**
- `hash_password`: Asynchronously hashes a password.
- `verify_password`: Verifies a plain text password against its hash.
- `verify_password_safe`: Safely verifies a password, preventing timing attacks.
- `generate_secure_token`: Generates a cryptographically secure token.
- `validate_password_strength`: Validates the strength of a password according to predefined rules.

**How it Fits into the Project:**
This file is crucial for user authentication and security in the backend. It integrates with other modules that handle user registration, login, and session management. The hashed passwords are stored securely, while validation ensures only strong passwords are accepted.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Uses `asyncio.to_thread` to offload CPU-intensive bcrypt operations from the main event loop.
- **Constant Time Verification:** Implements `verify_password_safe` to prevent timing attacks by always performing a hash operation, even for non-existent users.
- **Secure Token Generation:** Utilizes `secrets.token_urlsafe()` for generating secure tokens.
- **Password Validation:** Enforces complex password rules using regular expressions and type hints, ensuring user input meets security requirements.
```

This documentation provides an overview of the file's purpose, key functions, integration within the project, and significant design choices.
