## File Overview

### emergency-protocols.tsx

**Purpose and Responsibility:**
This file defines a component that displays emergency protocols for handling various emotional and physical crises, ensuring users know how to respond appropriately. It is part of a larger application aimed at supporting mental health and well-being.

**Key Exports or Public Interface:**
The primary export is the `ProtocolCard` component, which renders individual protocol cards with icons, titles, threat levels, and steps. The component leverages Tamagui for styling and React Native components for layout.

**How It Fits in the Project:**
This file resides within a directory structure that includes shared components and theme tokens. It is likely imported into a higher-level component or screen to display emergency protocols to users. The `emergencies` page might use this component to provide detailed guidance on how to handle different situations.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Icon Usage:** Icons from `lucide-react-native` are used to visually represent each protocol, enhancing user understanding.
- **Threat Levels:** Different threat levels are color-coded and styled differently to quickly convey the severity of a situation.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Each protocol includes multiple steps, providing detailed instructions for handling various scenarios.
- **Responsive Design:** The component uses Tamagui's responsive design features to ensure it looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

This file is crucial for ensuring users have clear guidance during critical moments, promoting a supportive environment within the application.
