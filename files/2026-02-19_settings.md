## File Overview

### Settings Configuration

**File Purpose and Responsibility:**
This file defines a comprehensive namespace for application settings, including business rules, constants, and limits used throughout the CertGames-Core backend. It ensures consistency and ease of configuration by centralizing all relevant parameters.

**Key Exports or Public Interface:**
- `Settings.Business`: A nested class containing various constants such as question limits, message lengths, coin rewards, streak milestones, and role levels.

**How it Fits in the Project:**
The `settings.py` file serves as a critical component of the CertGames-Core backend by providing a centralized location for configuration. It is imported by other modules to access settings, ensuring that all parts of the application use consistent values. This promotes maintainability and ease of modification across the project.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Modular Structure:** The `Settings` class uses nested classes (`Business`) to organize related settings, making it easier to manage and understand different aspects of the application.
- **Final Attributes:** All attributes are marked as `Final`, indicating that they should not be modified after initialization. This enforces immutability where appropriate and helps prevent accidental changes in critical constants.
- **Type Hints:** The use of type hints (e.g., `Final`, `Any`) enhances code readability and maintainability, making it clear which attributes are intended to remain constant.

This file is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of application settings across the CertGames-Core backend.
