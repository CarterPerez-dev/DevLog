## File Overview

# main.py Documentation

## Purpose and Responsibility
This file serves as the entry point for the FastAPI application, defining its structure and behavior. It initializes the API with necessary configurations, middleware, and routes.

## Key Exports or Public Interface
- `create_app()`: An application factory function that returns a configured FastAPI instance.
  - **Returns**: A `FastAPI` object

## How it Fits in the Project
This file acts as the central hub for the API. It imports routers from different modules (e.g., chat, STT, TTS, wake) and includes them with appropriate prefixes and tags. The factory function ensures that the application is properly configured with metadata, middleware, and endpoints.

## Notable Design Decisions
- **Application Factory**: Uses a factory pattern to create the FastAPI instance, promoting reusability and flexibility.
- **Middleware Configuration**: Configures CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests from any domain.
- **Route Inclusion**: Includes routers for various functionalities (TTS, STT, chat, wake) with consistent prefixes and tags, ensuring clear categorization in the API documentation.
- **Root and Health Endpoints**: Provides basic information about the application via a root endpoint and a health check to ensure service availability.
