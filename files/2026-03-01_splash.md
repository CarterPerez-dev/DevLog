## File Overview

# splash.go

## Purpose and Responsibility
This Go source file is responsible for rendering a splash screen during application startup. It uses `tea` for asynchronous event handling and `lipgloss` to style the text, ensuring a visually appealing initial display.

## Key Exports and Public Interface
- **SplashModel**: Represents the state of the splash screen.
  - `NewSplash()`: Creates a new instance of `SplashModel`.
  - `Init() tea.Cmd`: Starts a timer that triggers an event after 1.5 seconds, indicating the splash is done.
  - `Update(msg tea.Msg) (SplashModel, tea.Cmd)`: Updates the model based on messages received.
  - `View() string`: Returns the styled text for the splash screen.
  - `Done() bool`: Checks if the splash has completed.

## Fit into the Project
The `splash.go` file is part of the `ui` package and is used to provide a visually appealing initial display during application startup. It integrates with the main application flow by ensuring that critical setup tasks are completed before the user interface becomes active.

## Notable Design Decisions
- **Asynchronous Handling**: Uses `tea.Tick` for asynchronous event handling, allowing the splash screen to update without blocking other processes.
- **Styling with lipgloss**: Utilizes `lipgloss` for text styling, ensuring consistent and visually appealing output across different terminal environments.
- **Error-Free Design**: The model handles key events by setting a flag, ensuring no errors are returned in the update method.
```

This documentation provides an overview of the file's purpose, its role within the project, and highlights important design choices.
