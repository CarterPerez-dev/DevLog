## File Overview

### Purpose and Responsibility

This `config.py` file is responsible for defining application settings, including environment-specific configurations, database connections, security parameters, and API details. It leverages Pydantic to load these settings from environment variables, ensuring flexibility and ease of configuration.

### Key Exports and Public Interface

- **Settings**: A class representing the application's settings, loaded from `.env` files.
- **get_settings()**: A cached function that returns an instance of `Settings`.
- **settings**: A global instance of `Settings`, providing easy access to configurations throughout the application.

### How It Fits into the Project

This file serves as a central hub for configuration management. It ensures consistent and secure settings across different environments, such as development, testing, and production. The `Settings` class and its validation logic are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application's setup.

### Notable Design Decisions

- **Pydantic Settings**: Utilizes Pydantic to validate and load environment variables, ensuring type safety and robust configuration.
- **Caching**: Uses an LRU cache on `get_settings()` to avoid redundant parsing of environment variables.
- **Environment-Specific Validation**: Implements validation logic to enforce security constraints in the production environment, such as disabling debugging and restricting CORS origins.

This design ensures that the application can be easily configured for different environments while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
