## File Overview

# config.py

**Purpose and Responsibility:**
This Python file defines the core application settings and constants used throughout the `my-portfolio` project. It leverages Pydantic for structured configuration management, ensuring that environment variables are properly validated and loaded.

**Key Exports and Public Interface:**
The key exports include various constants (e.g., maximum lengths, cache namespaces) and a `Settings` class for application settings. The public interface also includes enums like `BlogCategory`, `CertificationCategory`, etc., which are used across the project to maintain consistency in data types.

**How it Fits into the Project:**
This file acts as the central hub for configuration management, providing a clear separation between runtime environment variables and code logic. It ensures that all parts of the application can access necessary settings and constants seamlessly.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Pydantic Settings:** Utilizes Pydantic's `BaseSettings` to load and validate environment variables.
- **Constants and Enums:** Defines a wide range of constants and enums for data validation, ensuring consistency across the project.
- **Environment Handling:** Configures different environments (development, production) with appropriate settings like debug mode and database URLs.

This setup enhances maintainability and flexibility by centralizing configuration management and providing robust type hints and validation.
