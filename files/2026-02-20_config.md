## File Overview

# config.ts

## Purpose and Responsibility
This TypeScript source file defines key configuration constants for API endpoints, query keys, routes, storage keys, and HTTP status codes. It serves as a central hub for maintaining consistent and easily accessible configurations throughout the project.

## Key Exports and Public Interface
- **API_ENDPOINTS**: A constant object containing URLs for various API endpoints.
- **QUERY_KEYS**: An object defining different types of query keys used in the application.
- **ROUTES**: A constant object specifying URL routes for different sections of the application.
- **STORAGE_KEYS**: Constants for storage keys, primarily related to UI state.
- **QUERY_CONFIG**: Configuration settings for various query-related behaviors like stale times and retry intervals.
- **HTTP_STATUS**: HTTP status codes used throughout the project.

## How It Fits in the Project
This file is crucial as it provides a single source of truth for all configuration constants. These constants are consumed by multiple components and services, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy across the codebase. The `API_ENDPOINTS` and `QUERY_KEYS` provide clear paths and identifiers that can be used to construct API requests and handle data queries efficiently.

## Notable Design Decisions
- **TypeScript Types**: Using TypeScript types like `ApiEndpoint`, `QueryKey`, and `Route` ensures type safety and improves code readability.
- **Const Assertions**: The use of `as const` in constant declarations helps with static analysis, ensuring that the values are treated as readonly and immutable.
- **Generics and Functions**: Functions within `BACKUPS` and `COLLECTIONS` provide flexibility by allowing dynamic construction of URLs based on input parameters.
```

This documentation covers the essential aspects of the file's role in the project, its key exports, and notable design choices.
