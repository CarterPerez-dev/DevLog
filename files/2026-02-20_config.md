## File Overview

# config.ts Documentation

**File Purpose and Responsibility:**
This file defines constants, endpoints, routes, query keys, storage keys, and HTTP status codes for the VueMantics frontend application. It serves as a central configuration hub, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across the project.

**Key Exports or Public Interface:**
- `API_ENDPOINTS`: Contains API endpoint URLs for various operations like authentication, uploads, search, etc.
- `WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINTS`: WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication.
- `QUERY_KEYS`: Query keys used in React Query for state management and caching strategies.
- `ROUTES`: Route paths for different pages and sections of the application.
- `STORAGE_KEYS`: Keys used for local storage to manage user data and UI settings.
- `QUERY_CONFIG`: Configuration for query stale times, garbage collection intervals, and retry policies.
- `HTTP_STATUS`: HTTP status codes for API responses.
- `PASSWORD_CONSTRAINTS`: Password validation constraints.
- `PAGINATION`: Default pagination parameters.

**How it Fits in the Project:**
This file is crucial as it centralizes configuration settings that are used throughout the application. It ensures consistency and ease of maintenance by providing a single source of truth for API endpoints, query keys, routes, and other critical configurations.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Type Safety**: The use of TypeScript types (`ApiEndpoint`, `QueryKey`, `Route`) enforces type safety and improves code readability.
- **Const Usage**: Constants are declared as `const` to ensure immutability and prevent accidental modifications.
- **API Versioning**: API endpoints include versioning (`v1`), allowing for future updates without breaking existing functionality.
