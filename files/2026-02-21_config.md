## File Overview

## config.py

**Purpose:** This file defines application settings using Pydantic, loading environment variables from a `.env` file. It provides configuration for various components such as API versioning, text-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-text (STT), large language model (LLM) services, and wake word detection.

**Key Exports:**
- `settings`: An instance of the `Settings` class containing application-specific configurations.
- `API_PREFIX`: A string representing the API version prefix.
- `ANGELA_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: A string defining the system prompt for the LLM.
- `OPENAPI_TAGS`: A list of dictionaries defining tags for OpenAPI documentation.

**Project Fit:**
This file is crucial as it centralizes configuration settings, making them easily accessible throughout the application. It ensures that environment-specific configurations are managed in a single place, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.

**Design Decisions:**
- **Pydantic Settings:** Utilizing `pydantic_settings` for type-safe and validated configuration loading.
- **Environment Variables:** Configurations are loaded from a `.env` file, allowing easy adjustments without code changes.
- **Case Insensitive:** The `case_sensitive = False` setting ensures that environment variables can be referenced in any case, enhancing flexibility.

This configuration file serves as the backbone for application settings, ensuring consistency and ease of customization across different environments.
