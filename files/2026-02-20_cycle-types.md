## File Overview

### Documenting `cycle.types.ts`

**File Purpose and Responsibility:**
This TypeScript file defines constants, types, and schemas related to menstrual cycle phases for a health tracking application. It provides essential data structures and utility functions to manage and display information about different cycle stages.

**Key Exports or Public Interface:**
- **CyclePhase:** An enum representing the various phases of a menstrual cycle.
- **PHASE_COLORS, PHASE_BG_COLORS, PHASE_LABELS, DEFCON_LEVELS, PHASE_CODENAMES, PHASE_DESCRIPTIONS, TACTICAL_TIPS:** Records mapping each phase to specific colors, background colors, labels, defense readiness levels, codenames, descriptions, and tactical tips. These are used for visual representation and user guidance.
- **cycleStatusSchema:** A Zod schema for validating cycle status data.

**How It Fits in the Project:**
This file is crucial for the project's health tracking module, providing a standardized way to handle menstrual cycle phases across different components. The exported constants and schemas ensure consistency and facilitate easy integration with other parts of the application, such as UI elements, notifications, and user guidance features.

**Notable Design Decisions:**
- **Zod Schema:** Utilizing Zod for validation ensures data integrity when handling cycle status information.
- **Enum with Constants:** Using an enum for `CyclePhase` enhances type safety and readability throughout the codebase.
- **Rich Metadata:** Detailed metadata like colors, labels, descriptions, and tactical tips provide a comprehensive user experience, making it easier to understand and navigate different phases of the menstrual cycle.
