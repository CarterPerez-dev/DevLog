## File Overview

### _process_upload_with_retry.py

**Purpose:**
This file implements a robust upload processing mechanism with retry logic, designed to handle single uploads within an upload batch. It ensures that each upload is processed multiple times if initial attempts fail, and it monitors the progress of AI services during the process.

**Key Exports/Interface:**
- `process_upload_with_retry(ai_service: LocalAIService, upload: Upload, batch: UploadBatch) -> bool`: The primary function responsible for processing an individual upload with retry logic. It returns a boolean indicating success or failure after retries.

**Project Integration:**
This file is part of the backend workers module in the `vuemantics` repository and is crucial for handling media uploads. It integrates with AI services, storage services, and batch progress monitoring to ensure seamless processing even if initial attempts fail. The function updates the upload status and publishes real-time progress to a batch.

**Design Decisions:**
- **Retry Logic:** Implements up to two retries on failure.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Uses an asynchronous task to monitor AI service stages and update progress in real-time.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles exceptions, including user-initiated deletions during processing.
- **Concurrency:** Utilizes asyncio for concurrent execution of tasks, ensuring efficient handling of upload processes.

This file plays a critical role in maintaining the reliability and efficiency of media uploads within the system.
