## File Overview

## Base Payout Adapter Interface

### Purpose and Responsibility
This file defines an abstract base class `PayoutAdapter` for handling payout operations across different payment systems. It ensures that all payout adapters adhere to a consistent interface, facilitating easy integration and extension.

### Key Exports and Public API
- **`send_payout(user_id: str, amount: float, currency: str, recipient_data: dict[str, Any]) -> PayoutResult:`**  
  Processes a payout transaction for a user.
- **`validate_recipient(recipient_data: dict[str, Any]) -> RecipientValidation:`**  
  Validates the recipient data before attempting to send a payout.

### How It Fits into the Project
This base class serves as the foundation for specific payout adapter implementations. It is part of the `stripe_referral` module and is intended to be subclassed by concrete adapters like Stripe, PayPal, etc., which handle the actual payment processing logic.

### Notable Design Decisions
- **Abstract Methods:** The use of abstract methods enforces a consistent interface across different adapters.
- **Type Hints:** Comprehensive type hints ensure robustness and clarity in method signatures.
- **TypedDicts for Results:** `PayoutResult` and `RecipientValidation` TypedDicts provide structured return values, making error handling and validation straightforward.
```

This documentation provides an overview of the file's purpose, key exports, its role within the project, and highlights important design choices.
