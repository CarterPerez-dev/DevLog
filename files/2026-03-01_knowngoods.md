## File Overview

// ©AngelaMos | 2026
// knowngoods.go

### Purpose and Responsibility
This file defines a map of known good processes for an audit tool, specifically targeting Linux systems running KDE Plasma desktop environments. It lists essential system services and KDE applications to ensure they are present and functioning correctly during audits.

### Key Exports and Public Interface
The `KnownGoodProcesses` map is the primary export, providing a comprehensive list of system services and applications deemed "known good." This map serves as a reference for validating the integrity of the system being audited.

### Fit in the Project
In the larger project (`Yoshi-Audit`), this file plays a crucial role in ensuring that critical components of both the Linux kernel and KDE Plasma environment are accounted for during audits. It is part of the `audit` package, which contains tools and utilities to check system health and compliance.

### Notable Design Decisions
- **Map Structure**: The use of a map allows for efficient lookup and management of known good processes.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The list includes both core system services (`systemd`, `NetworkManager`) and KDE-specific applications (`plasmashell`, `konsole`), ensuring a holistic audit approach.
- **Modularity**: By centralizing the list in one file, updates or additions can be made more easily without altering multiple parts of the codebase.

This design ensures that audits are thorough and consistent across different systems while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
