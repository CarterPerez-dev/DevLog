## File Overview

### Purpose and Responsibility
This file serves as an **entry point** for schema definitions within the `stripe-referral` module, providing a centralized location for all key data models used throughout the application.

### Key Exports or Public Interface
The file exports various request and response schemas for handling referral creation, tracking, payouts, and program management. These include:
- Referral-related schemas: `CreateCodeRequest`, `CreateCodeResponse`, `TrackReferralRequest`, `TrackReferralResponse`, etc.
- Payout-related schemas: `ProcessPayoutRequest`, `ProcessPayoutResponse`, `RecipientValidationRequest`, etc.

### How It Fits in the Project
This file acts as a **module-level interface** for the `stripe-referral` project, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different components. By centralizing schema definitions here, it simplifies import statements and maintains a clear separation of concerns within the codebase.

### Notable Design Decisions
- **Centralized Schema Management**: All schemas are grouped in one place to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.
- **Type Hints and Validation**: Use of explicit type hints (`CreateCodeResult`, `TrackReferralResult`, etc.) ensures robust validation and improves code readability.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Schemas follow a consistent naming pattern, making it easier for developers to understand their purpose at a glance.
```

This documentation provides an overview of the file's role in the project, highlights its key exports, explains how it integrates with other parts of the system, and notes some design choices that enhance maintainability.
