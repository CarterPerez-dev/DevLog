## Class Documentation

### SimilarUploadsRequest

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `SimilarUploadsRequest` class is a Pydantic model designed to validate and structure input parameters for a request aimed at finding uploads similar to a specific upload. It ensures that only valid and expected data are passed into the system, maintaining robustness and consistency.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Fields:**
  - `upload_id`: A UUID representing the ID of the upload for which similar items need to be found.
  - `limit`: An integer specifying the maximum number of similar uploads to return. The default value is set by `SIMILAR_UPLOADS_DEFAULT_LIMIT`, with a range between 1 and 50 inclusive.
  - `similarity_threshold`: A float representing the minimum similarity score required for an upload to be considered similar. The default value is defined by `SIMILAR_UPLOADS_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`, with a range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive.
  - `include_same_user`: A boolean indicating whether uploads from the same user should be included in the search results.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic is used for data validation, ensuring that only valid input parameters are accepted by the system. This helps prevent runtime errors and ensures data integrity.
- **Field Descriptions:** The use of `description` within `Field` allows for clear documentation directly in the code.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
This class serves as a key component in the search module, acting as a validation layer for incoming requests. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and services responsible for executing the similarity search logic. By enforcing strict input validation, `SimilarUploadsRequest` ensures that the system remains robust and reliable, facilitating seamless integration within the broader application architecture.
