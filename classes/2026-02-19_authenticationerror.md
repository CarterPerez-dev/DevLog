### AuthenticationError Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `AuthenticationError` class is a custom exception derived from the base `BaseAppException`. It is specifically designed to handle authentication failures within the application, ensuring that appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place for security-related issues.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Constructor (`__init__` method)**: Initializes an instance of `AuthenticationError` with a default message "Authentication failed" and an optional dictionary of extra information. It also sets the HTTP status code to 401, indicating unauthorized access.

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    message: str = "Authentication failed",
    extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> None:
    super().__init__(
        message=message,
        status_code=401,
        extra=extra
    )
```

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class leverages the **Factory Method Pattern** indirectly through inheritance. By extending `BaseAppException`, it adheres to a consistent error handling strategy across the application.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`AuthenticationError` is part of the exception hierarchy, which helps maintain a clean and organized error management system. This class ensures that any authentication-related errors are handled appropriately, providing clear messages and status codes. It integrates seamlessly with other parts of the application by being raised when necessary, such as during user login or access control checks.

This design promotes robust error handling and enhances the overall reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
