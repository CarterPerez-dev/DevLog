## Class Documentation

### UserNotFound Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `UserNotFound` class is a custom exception derived from `ResourceNotFound`. It is specifically designed to handle scenarios where a user cannot be found within the system. This class ensures that any part of the application encountering such an issue can raise this exception, providing clear and consistent error handling.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, identifier: str | int, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: 
  - **Parameters**:
    - `identifier`: A string or integer representing the unique identifier of the user.
    - `extra`: An optional dictionary containing additional information about the error context.
  - This constructor initializes the exception with details about the missing user and any extra metadata.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Inheritance**: The class inherits from a base `ResourceNotFound` exception, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. It allows for extending functionality without modifying existing code.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
The `UserNotFound` class is part of the error handling mechanism within the application's core layer. It integrates with the broader exception handling strategy by providing a specific type of exception that can be caught and handled appropriately at higher levels of the application. This ensures that user-related errors are managed consistently, enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the codebase.
