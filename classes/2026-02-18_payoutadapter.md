## Class Documentation

### PayoutAdapter Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `PayoutAdapter` class serves as an abstract base class for implementing payout mechanisms, ensuring a standardized approach to processing payouts across different payment gateways or systems. This abstraction promotes modularity and ease of integration by defining common methods that must be implemented by concrete adapter classes.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`send_payout`:** Processes a payout transaction with specified parameters such as `user_id`, `amount`, `currency`, and `recipient_data`. It returns a `PayoutResult` object indicating the success or failure of the transaction.
- **`validate_recipient`:** Validates recipient data before attempting to send a payout. This method ensures that the recipient information is correct and complete, returning a `RecipientValidation` object.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class employs the **Abstract Factory Method** pattern by defining abstract methods (`send_payout`, `validate_recipient`) that concrete adapter classes must implement. This allows for flexible and extensible payout processing without tightly coupling the core system to specific payment gateways.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`PayoutAdapter` is a key component of the architecture, acting as an intermediary between the application logic and various payment gateway implementations. By adhering to the abstract interface defined by `PayoutAdapter`, different payout mechanisms can be seamlessly integrated into the system, ensuring that the core application remains agnostic of specific payment systems while maintaining consistent behavior in handling payouts.
