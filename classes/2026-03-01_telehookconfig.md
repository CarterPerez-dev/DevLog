```python

    bot_token: str
    chat_id: str
    base_url: str = "https://api.telegram.org"

    @classmethod
    def from_env(cls) -> "TelehookConfig":
        bot_token = os.environ.get("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN")
        chat_id = os.environ.get("TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID")

        missing = []
        if not bot_token:
            missing.append("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN")
        if not chat_id:

## Class Documentation

### Class Documentation: `TelehookConfig`

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `TelehookConfig` class is responsible for managing configuration settings required to interact with a Telegram bot API, specifically for sending messages. It ensures that necessary environment variables are set before initializing an instance.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`from_env()`**: A class method that initializes the `TelehookConfig` object by reading necessary environment variables (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`). If any required environment variable is missing, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **`send_url` (property)**: Returns the URL for sending messages to the specified chat ID using the Telegram bot API.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class uses the **Factory Method Pattern** through the `from_env()` class method. This pattern allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete classes, ensuring that configuration is managed centrally and securely.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`TelehookConfig` plays a crucial role in setting up the application's environment-specific configurations. It ensures that all necessary parameters are available before any interaction with the Telegram API occurs. This class is likely used as an input for other components responsible for sending notifications or managing chat interactions, making it a central point of configuration management within the `Telehook` system.

This design promotes modularity and separation of concerns, allowing different parts of the application to focus on their specific responsibilities while leveraging shared configuration settings.
