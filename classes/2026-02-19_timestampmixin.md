## Class Documentation

### TimestampMixin

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `TimestampMixin` is a mixin class designed to automatically manage `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for database models that inherit from it. This helps maintain audit trails by tracking when records are created and last updated.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- No public methods are defined in this class; its functionality is entirely encapsulated within the `created_at` and `updated_at` attributes.
- The `created_at` attribute is initialized with the current UTC time at object creation.
- The `updated_at` attribute is updated to the current UTC time whenever the object is saved.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class utilizes the **Mixin Design Pattern**, which allows it to be mixed into other classes without requiring inheritance from a specific base class. This approach promotes code reuse and keeps related functionality together, enhancing maintainability.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`TimestampMixin` plays a crucial role in the database layer of the `stripe-referral` application by providing consistent timestamp management across multiple models. By inheriting from this mixin, any model can automatically track creation and update times without needing to manually manage these attributes in each class definition. This simplifies the codebase and ensures uniformity in timestamp handling throughout the application.
