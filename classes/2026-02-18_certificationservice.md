## Class Documentation

### CertificationService Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `CertificationService` class handles business logic related to certifications, including fetching, listing, and categorizing certifications based on various criteria such as ID, language, category, and visibility status.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- `get_by_id(certification_id)`: Retrieves a certification by its unique identifier.
- `list_visible(language, skip=0, limit=config.PAGINATION_DEFAULT_LIMIT)`: Lists visible certifications for a given language with pagination support.
- `list_active(language)`: Lists non-expired certifications for a given language.
- `list_by_category(category, language)`: Lists certifications by category and language.
- `get_badges(language)`: Retrieves brief certification data for overview badges.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class leverages the **Repository Pattern** through its interactions with `CertificationRepository` to abstract away database operations. This pattern ensures that business logic remains separate from data access concerns, promoting clean separation of concerns and easier testing.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`CertificationService` acts as a service layer within the application architecture, providing high-level operations on certifications. It interfaces with `CertificationRepository`, which handles database interactions, ensuring that the service layer remains agnostic to persistence details. This design supports a robust and maintainable codebase, making it easier to manage complex business logic while keeping data access concerns encapsulated.
