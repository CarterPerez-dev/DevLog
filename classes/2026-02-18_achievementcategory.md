## Class Documentation

### AchievementCategory

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `AchievementCategory` class is an enumeration of achievement categories, providing a structured way to represent different types of achievements within the application. This class ensures that category names are consistent and easily accessible throughout the codebase.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **choices()**: Returns a list of enum values suitable for use with MongoDB's `choices` field type.
- **values()**: An alias for `choices()`, returning the same list of enum values.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class leverages Python’s `Enum` metaclass to create a set of named constants, adhering to the Singleton pattern by ensuring that each category name is unique. The use of class methods (`choices` and `values`) provides a convenient interface for interacting with these enum values without instantiating the class.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
The `AchievementCategory` enumeration plays a crucial role in the CertGames-Core backend architecture, particularly within the Progression domain. It is used to categorize achievements, ensuring that different types of achievements are clearly defined and managed. This helps maintain consistency and clarity when querying or updating achievement data, especially for database operations using MongoDB. The `choices()` method facilitates integration with MongoDB’s validation mechanisms, making it easier to define constraints on related fields in the database schema.
