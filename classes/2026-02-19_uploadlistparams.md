## Class Documentation

### UploadListParams Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `UploadListParams` class is designed to encapsulate parameters for listing uploads with various filters, sorting options, and state management. It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on providing a structured way to filter and sort upload lists.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Attributes:** The class defines several attributes such as `file_type`, `processing_status`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`, and `show_hidden`. These attributes allow for flexible filtering, sorting, and state management of uploads.
  
**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Data Class with Pydantic:** This class leverages Pydantic's data class feature to define structured input parameters. It uses type hints (e.g., `FileType`, `ProcessingStatus`) and default values to ensure that the parameters are well-defined and validated.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`UploadListParams` is part of a broader schema system within the `/schemas/upload.py` file, which likely contains other related schemas. It interacts with the main application logic through API endpoints or services that use these parameters to fetch filtered upload lists from the database. The class ensures that only valid and expected parameters are passed, enhancing both the robustness and maintainability of the codebase.

This class is typically used in conjunction with pagination mechanisms (e.g., `PaginationParams`) to provide a comprehensive set of options for listing uploads, making it a key component in handling dynamic and flexible data retrieval operations.
