## Class Documentation

### ProjectService Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ProjectService` class encapsulates business logic for managing project operations within a portfolio application. It interacts with the database through a repository to perform CRUD-like operations, ensuring that project data is handled consistently across different use cases.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- `get_by_id`: Retrieves a project by its ID.
- `get_by_slug`: Fetches a project by its slug and language, used for public pages.
- `list_visible`: Lists visible projects for a given language with pagination support.
- `list_featured`: Returns featured projects for a specific language.
- `get_nav_items`: Provides minimal project data for sidebar navigation.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class leverages the **Repository Pattern**, where `ProjectService` delegates database operations to `ProjectRepository`. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and testability. Additionally, the use of type hints (`UUID`, `Language`) aligns with Pythonic practices, ensuring clear and robust interfaces.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`ProjectService` acts as a mediator between the application logic and the data layer. By abstracting database interactions behind the repository, it allows for easier changes to the underlying storage mechanism without affecting other parts of the system. The class also adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, focusing solely on project-related business logic while delegating persistence concerns to `ProjectRepository`.
