### StripeReferralError

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `StripeReferralError` class serves as a base exception for all stripe referral-related errors within the application. It provides a structured way to handle exceptions by including both a message and additional context, which can be useful for debugging and logging.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str, **context: Any) -> None`:** Initializes the exception with a message and optional context. The `message` parameter is required to provide a clear error description, while the `context` allows additional details such as specific error codes or user IDs.
- **`__str__(self) -> str`:** Overrides the default string representation of the exception, formatting it to include both the message and any provided context.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class does not explicitly use a design pattern but follows Python's idiomatic approach by leveraging inheritance from `Exception`. It provides a structured way to handle exceptions that can be extended or modified without altering the base behavior.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`StripeReferralError` is part of the error handling mechanism within the application. By providing a clear and structured exception, it ensures that any stripe-related errors are handled consistently across different parts of the codebase. This class can be extended by other specific exceptions to provide more detailed error handling, making the overall architecture more robust and maintainable.
