### PermissionDenied Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `PermissionDenied` class is a custom exception raised when a user lacks the required permissions to perform an action within the application. It inherits from a base exception class, `BaseAppException`, which likely provides common exception handling mechanisms.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Constructor (`__init__` method)**: Initializes the exception with a default message "Permission denied" and allows specifying a required permission and additional metadata as keyword arguments.
  ```python
  def __init__(
      self,
      message: str = "Permission denied",
      required_permission: str | None = None,
      extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
  ) -> None:
      super().__init__(
          message=message,
          status_code=403,
          extra=extra
      )
      self.required_permission = required_permission
  ```

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Inheritance**: The `PermissionDenied` class inherits from a base exception class, potentially allowing for polymorphism and consistent handling of exceptions across the application.
- **Factory Pattern**: While not explicitly used here, this class could be part of a broader factory pattern where different types of exceptions are created based on specific conditions.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`PermissionDenied` is likely used throughout the FastAPI application to handle permission-related errors. By raising this exception when necessary, it ensures that appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden) and additional context (like required permissions) are propagated correctly. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns between business logic and error handling, contributing to a robust and maintainable architecture.
