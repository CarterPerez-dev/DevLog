## Class Documentation

### SearchResponse Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `SearchResponse` class is designed to encapsulate the results of a search operation, including metadata about the query, results, and execution time. It ensures that only valid data can be passed by forbidding extra fields and providing clear constraints on field values.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Fields:**
  - `results`: A list of `SearchResult` objects ordered by similarity.
  - `total_found`: Total number of matching results.
  - `returned_count`: Number of results returned, which may be less than the limit.
  - `search_time_ms`: Execution time of the search query in milliseconds.
  - `query`: The original search query string.
  - `query_embedding_generated`: Boolean indicating whether the embedding was successfully generated.
  - `applied_filters`: Optional dictionary containing filters applied to the search.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Data Classes**: Utilizes Pydantic's `BaseModel` for structured data validation and serialization, ensuring that all fields are properly typed and validated according to specified constraints.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
The `SearchResponse` class is part of the backend schema layer, specifically designed to handle search responses. It interfaces with higher-level components such as API endpoints or service layers by providing a standardized structure for search results. This ensures consistency across different parts of the application and simplifies data handling and validation processes. The class also integrates seamlessly with other Pydantic models and frameworks, maintaining a clean and modular architecture.
