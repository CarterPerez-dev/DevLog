## Class Documentation

### CertificationFactory Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose**
The `CertificationFactory` class serves as a factory for creating test certifications. It ensures that each certification instance has a unique identifier and provides default values where necessary.

**Public Interface (Key Methods)**
- **`create(session: AsyncSession, *, language: Language = Language.ENGLISH, name: str | None = None, issuer: str | None = None, date_obtained: date | None = None, expiry_date: date | None = None, is_expired: bool = False, category: CertificationCategory = CertificationCategory.CLOUD, is_visible: bool = True) -> Certification`**: Asynchronously creates a new certification instance with optional parameters. It sets default values for missing or unspecified fields.
- **`reset() -> None`**: Resets the internal counter used to generate unique identifiers.

**Design Patterns Used**
The `CertificationFactory` class employs the **Factory Method** pattern, providing a method (`create`) that encapsulates object creation logic and ensures consistent initialization of certification objects. The use of default parameters allows for flexible instantiation while maintaining consistency in required fields.

**How it Fits in the Architecture**
In the context of the `/home/yoshi/dev/CURRENT/portfolio/v1/backend/conftest.py` file, `CertificationFactory` is likely used to generate test data for unit tests or integration tests. It fits into the architecture by providing a standardized way to create certification objects with predefined attributes, ensuring that tests can rely on consistent and predictable data.
