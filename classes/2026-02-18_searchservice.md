## Class Documentation

### SearchService Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `SearchService` class is responsible for handling search operations across all portfolio content. It encapsulates business logic related to searching, leveraging a repository layer for database interactions.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, session: AsyncSession) -> None`:** Initializes the service with an asynchronous database session.
- **`async def search(self, query: str, language: Language | None, limit: int = 20) -> SearchResponse`:** Executes a search operation based on the provided query and optional language. The method returns a `SearchResponse` object containing the total number of results and a list of matching items.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class does not explicitly use any design patterns but follows a simple service layer pattern, separating business logic from data access. It leverages dependency injection for the database session to ensure testability and flexibility.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`SearchService` acts as a high-level service that interacts with the `SearchRepository` to perform searches. This design allows for easy integration of different search strategies or repositories without altering the core business logic, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. The class is part of the application's domain layer, providing a clean interface between the business logic and the data access layer.
