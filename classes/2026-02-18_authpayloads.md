## Class Documentation

### AuthPayloads Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `AuthPayloads` class serves as a utility for generating and managing test payloads related to authentication and authorization mechanisms, particularly focusing on JWT (JSON Web Token) attacks and common header names used in API security testing.

**Public Interface:**
- **get_all_headers()**: Returns a list of common authentication header names.
- **get_jwt_none_variants()**: Provides a list of JWT none algorithm case variations for testing purposes.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class does not explicitly use any design patterns. However, it follows Pythonic practices such as using class methods to provide utility functions without the need for an instance.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
This class is part of the `scanners/payloads.py` file within a larger project structure focused on API security scanning. It interacts with other classes and modules that perform security testing by providing predefined payloads and headers.

**State Management Approach:**
The class maintains its state through static lists defined at the class level, ensuring these values are consistent across all instances without requiring instance variables or complex state management.
