### ResourceNotFound Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ResourceNotFound` class is a custom exception derived from `BaseAppException`. It is specifically designed to be raised when a requested resource does not exist within an application. This helps in maintaining clear error handling and provides consistent behavior for missing resources.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, resource: str, identifier: str | int, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: Initializes the exception with a specific message indicating that the requested resource was not found. The `resource` parameter specifies the type of resource, while `identifier` provides the unique identifier for the missing resource. The optional `extra` dictionary can be used to include additional context or information.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Factory Pattern**: While this class is a simple exception and does not directly implement the factory pattern, it could be part of a broader design where exceptions are dynamically created based on specific conditions.
  
**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
The `ResourceNotFound` class fits into the application's error handling architecture by providing a standardized way to handle resource-related errors. By inheriting from `BaseAppException`, it ensures that all such exceptions follow a consistent structure and can be easily caught and handled at higher levels of the application. This promotes robust error management, making the code more maintainable and easier to debug.

This class is typically used in API endpoints or business logic where resource validation is necessary, ensuring that users receive clear and meaningful responses when resources are not found.
