## Class Documentation

### ValidationError Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ValidationError` class is designed to handle exceptions that occur when input validation fails outside of Pydantic models. This class extends a base exception class, providing a standardized way to manage these errors within the application.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str, field: str | None = None, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: Initializes the `ValidationError` instance with a custom error message, an optional field name indicating which field failed validation, and additional metadata.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Inheritance**: The class inherits from a base exception class (`BaseAppException`), allowing it to leverage common exception handling mechanisms.
  
**Relationship to Other Classes:**
This class is part of the `core.exceptions` module in the `ios-test` repository. It is used throughout the application to handle validation errors, ensuring consistency and providing clear error messages.

**State Management Approach:**
The class maintains a simple state with the error message, field name (if applicable), and any additional metadata provided via the `extra` parameter. This approach ensures that all necessary information about the validation failure is easily accessible for logging or user feedback.
