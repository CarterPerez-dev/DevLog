## Class Documentation

### SQLiPayloads

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `SQLiPayloads` class is responsible for providing a comprehensive collection of SQL Injection test payloads tailored to different database types and techniques. It aims to help security scanners identify potential vulnerabilities by simulating various injection attacks.

**Public Interface:**
- **get_all_payloads()**: Returns a combined list of all SQL injection payloads.
- **get_error_signatures()**: Provides error signatures for detecting specific database types, aiding in the identification of the underlying database system during an attack.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class does not explicitly use any design patterns. However, it follows a modular approach by organizing different payload categories (e.g., `BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS`, `UNION_BASED`) as separate attributes, which can be seen as a form of encapsulation and modularity.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
This class is part of the backend module for an API security scanner. It interacts with other classes that handle scanning logic by providing payloads and error signatures. The payloads are used during the scanning process to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, while the error signatures help in identifying the database type based on the response.

**State Management Approach:**
The class maintains a static state through its attributes (`ERROR_SIGNATURES`, `BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS`, etc.), which do not change once initialized. The methods are class methods, allowing them to be called without instantiating the class.
