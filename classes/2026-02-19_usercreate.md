## Class Documentation

### UserCreate Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `UserCreate` class is a subclass of `UserBase`, designed to handle user registration requests, specifically focusing on password validation. It ensures that passwords meet certain criteria, such as length and character complexity.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Model Configuration:** The `model_config` attribute configures the model's behavior, including strict field validation and whitespace stripping.
- **Password Field:** The `password` field is a string with specific constraints on its length and content. It includes metadata for password requirements.
- **Field Validator Method:** The `validate_password` method uses centralized validation logic to ensure the password meets predefined strength criteria.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class employs the **Field Validation Pattern**, where custom validators are used to enforce business rules during object construction. No explicit design patterns like Factory, Observer, or Strategy are directly applied here, but the use of field validators is a common pattern in data validation scenarios.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`UserCreate` fits into the broader architecture by providing a standardized way to validate user registration requests. This ensures that all new users meet the necessary criteria before being stored in the database. The class interacts with other parts of the system, such as password strength validation logic and user creation services, making it a crucial component for maintaining data integrity during the registration process.
