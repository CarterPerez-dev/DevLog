## Class Documentation

### CacheManager Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `CacheManager` class manages Redis connections and client lifecycle, ensuring efficient and reliable interaction with a Redis cache system. It initializes a connection pool and client, provides methods for health checks, and supports asynchronous pipeline operations.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **init**: Initializes the Redis connection pool and client using provided configuration.
- **close**: Closes the Redis client and disposes of the connection pool.
- **ping**: Performs a health check by pinging the Redis server.
- **client**: Returns the Redis client instance, raising an error if not initialized.
- **is_available**: Checks if the Redis client is available.
- **pipeline**: Context manager for performing pipeline operations on the Redis client.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Factory Pattern**: Implicitly used in `init` to create a connection pool and client from configuration parameters.
- **Context Manager**: Utilized in `pipeline` for managing asynchronous pipeline operations efficiently.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
The `CacheManager` class is part of the application's caching layer, interacting with Redis to store and retrieve data. It integrates seamlessly with other components that require cache access, such as FastAPI services or database layers.

**State Management Approach:**
The class maintains state through instance variables `_pool` and `_client`, ensuring thread-safe operations using Python’s built-in threading mechanisms. The `init` method initializes these states based on provided configuration, while the `close` method ensures proper cleanup by disposing of resources.
