## Class Documentation

### Class Documentation: `EmailAlreadyExists`

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `EmailAlreadyExists` class is a custom exception subclass designed to handle scenarios where an attempt is made to register with an email address that already exists in the system. This ensures that registration processes can gracefully handle duplicate emails, providing clear error messages and additional context when necessary.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Constructor (`__init__` method)**: Initializes the exception with a specific message indicating that the provided email is already registered. It accepts an `email` parameter to store the offending email address and an optional `extra` dictionary for additional metadata.

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    email: str,
    extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None
) -> None:
```

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Subclassing**: The class inherits from a base `ConflictError`, adhering to the inheritance pattern where specific exceptions are derived from more general ones. This helps in organizing and categorizing errors within the application.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`EmailAlreadyExists` plays a crucial role in the error handling mechanism of the social media notes backend application. By raising this exception when an attempt is made to register with an existing email, it ensures that the registration process can be properly managed and controlled. This class is part of the core exceptions module, which handles various types of errors that may arise during different operations within the application. Its use promotes a consistent approach to error management across the system, making it easier to identify and handle specific error conditions related to email conflicts.
