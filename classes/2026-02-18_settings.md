## Class Documentation

### Documentation for `Settings` Class

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for loading application settings from environment variables, ensuring that these settings are properly validated and configured before the application starts. It adheres to the Singleton pattern by inheriting from `BaseSettings`, which helps in managing configuration across different parts of the application.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Model Validator (`@model_validator(mode='after')`)**: This method enforces security constraints specific to the production environment, ensuring that sensitive settings like `DEBUG` and `CORS_ORIGINS` are correctly configured. It raises a `ValueError` if these conditions are not met.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Singleton Pattern**: Inherited from `BaseSettings`, which ensures that only one instance of the configuration is created.
- **Validation**: Utilizes Pydantic's model validation to enforce constraints on settings, ensuring type safety and proper configuration.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
The `Settings` class plays a crucial role in the application’s architecture by providing a centralized source for all configuration-related data. It ensures that environment-specific configurations are properly loaded and validated before the application starts. This helps in maintaining consistency across different environments (development, testing, production) and enhances security by enforcing strict validation rules during runtime.

By leveraging Pydantic's `BaseSettings` and model validators, this class provides a robust mechanism for managing configuration settings, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.
