## Class Documentation

### Class Documentation: `Settings`

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class serves as a central namespace for storing business rules, constants, and configurations required by various components of the CertGames-Core backend application. It encapsulates numerous static attributes related to limits, lengths, rewards, milestones, and roles, ensuring that these values are easily accessible throughout the codebase.

**Public Interface:**
- The class primarily provides a collection of constant attributes (using `Final` type hints for immutability) such as limits, message lengths, coin rewards, XP gains, and role definitions. There are no public methods; all interactions with this class involve accessing these static attributes directly.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The use of constants and final variables is a form of the Singleton pattern in Python, ensuring that these settings are globally accessible without creating multiple instances. This approach helps maintain consistency across the application by centralizing configuration values.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
- The `Settings` class is referenced throughout the backend codebase for accessing various configurations. It interacts indirectly with other classes and modules through static method calls or direct attribute access, providing a centralized point of truth for settings that are immutable during runtime.

This design ensures that changes to core application settings can be managed in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies across different parts of the system.
