## Class Documentation

### Settings Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class serves as a central namespace for storing various configuration constants, business rules, and limits that are crucial for the operation of the CertGames-Core application. It encapsulates key settings related to user interactions, testing mechanisms, support functionalities, and more.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- The class primarily provides static attributes representing different configurations such as question limits, message lengths, coin rewards, and various thresholds. These constants are accessed via attribute access rather than method calls.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The `Settings` class leverages the **Singleton Pattern** implicitly by providing a namespace for shared settings without explicitly implementing a singleton pattern. It also uses **Final Attributes** to ensure that certain configurations cannot be changed once set, ensuring consistency and preventing accidental modifications during runtime.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
This class acts as a core component of the application's configuration layer, providing essential constants to other modules such as user management, testing systems, support tools, and more. By centralizing these settings, it promotes modularity and ease of maintenance across different parts of the application. The `Settings` class is imported and used throughout the backend codebase to ensure that all components adhere to a unified set of rules and limits.
