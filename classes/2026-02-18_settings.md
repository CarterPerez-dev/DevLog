## Class Documentation

### Documentation for `Settings` Class

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for loading application settings from environment variables using Python's `pydantic` library. It ensures that configuration values are validated against specified constraints, providing a robust foundation for the backend application.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Model Validator (`validate_production_settings`)**: This method enforces security constraints in production environments by raising errors if certain settings violate best practices.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Factory Pattern**: Implicitly used through `BaseSettings`, which initializes and validates the configuration.
- **Strategy Pattern**: The `model_config` dictionary allows for flexible configuration loading from environment files, supporting different environments without changing the class structure.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
The `Settings` class is a core component of the application's configuration layer. It interacts with other classes such as database connection managers and API routers by providing essential settings like `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, and CORS policies. The settings are used throughout the application, ensuring consistency and security.

**State Management Approach:**
The state of the application is managed through environment variables, which are loaded into the `Settings` object during initialization. This approach decouples configuration from code and allows for easy deployment across different environments by simply changing environment variables.
