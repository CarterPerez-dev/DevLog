## Class Documentation

### Challenge Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Challenge` class models a 30-day content creation and job application challenge cycle, tracking various metrics such as content goals and job applications.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- No public methods are defined within the class. The primary interactions occur through relationships with other entities like `ChallengeLog`.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Mappers**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy's ORM mappings to define database columns and relationships.
- **Mixins**: Inherits from `Base`, `UUIDMixin`, and `TimestampMixin` to manage common attributes like UUIDs and timestamps.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
- The class has a relationship with `ChallengeLog` through the `logs` attribute, allowing tracking of individual challenge logs. This relationship is bidirectional via `back_populates`.

**State Management Approach:**
The state of a challenge is managed by its attributes such as `name`, `start_date`, and `is_active`. The class ensures these are properly initialized with default values.

This class fits into the architecture by providing a structured way to manage and track 30-day challenges, integrating seamlessly with other models through relationships.
