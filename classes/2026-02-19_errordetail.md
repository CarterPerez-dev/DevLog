## Class Documentation

### ErrorDetail Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ErrorDetail` class defines a standardized error response format for API responses. It encapsulates the human-readable error message (`detail`) and the exception class name (`type`), ensuring consistency across error handling mechanisms.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Fields:**
  - `detail`: A string representing the human-readable error message.
  - `type`: A string indicating the type of exception, typically the class name.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class leverages Pydantic's data validation and serialization capabilities. While no specific design pattern like Factory or Observer is explicitly used, it adheres to the Data Class pattern by providing a structured way to handle error details in API responses.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`ErrorDetail` plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency across the application’s error handling mechanisms. By standardizing the structure of error responses, it ensures that all parts of the system can easily parse and handle errors uniformly. This class is part of the `core/error_schemas.py` module, which likely contains other schema definitions for data validation and serialization. The use of Pydantic's `model_config` with examples provides a clear specification of expected error formats, making it easier to integrate and test different components of the application.

This class documentation helps maintain clarity in the codebase by defining its purpose, key methods, design principles, and integration within the overall architecture.
