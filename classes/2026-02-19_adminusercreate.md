### AdminUserCreate Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `AdminUserCreate` class is a Pydantic schema designed to validate data for creating new user accounts by an administrator. It ensures that all necessary fields are provided with appropriate constraints, such as email format validation, password length limits, and role assignment.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Fields:**
  - `email`: An EmailStr type field ensuring the email is formatted correctly.
  - `password`: A string field constrained by minimum and maximum lengths.
  - `full_name`: An optional string field with a maximum length constraint.
  - `role`: A required `UserRole` enum defaulting to `USER`.
  - `is_active`: A boolean indicating if the user account is active, defaulting to `True`.
  - `is_verified`: A boolean indicating if the user's email has been verified, defaulting to `False`.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Data Validation:** The class uses Pydantic for data validation and type hints, ensuring that only valid data can be passed through.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`AdminUserCreate` is part of the schema layer within the backend application. It interacts with the user creation logic by providing validated input to the service layer or directly to the database via an ORM. This class ensures that any user created through administrative actions meets predefined criteria, enhancing data integrity and security.

This schema is crucial for maintaining consistent and secure user management practices across the application.
