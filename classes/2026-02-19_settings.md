## Class Documentation

### Class Documentation: `Settings`

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for loading application settings from environment variables, ensuring that critical configuration values such as database URLs, API keys, and operational parameters are properly initialized before the application starts.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- No public methods are defined in this class. It primarily serves to store and provide access to configuration settings via its attributes.
- Attributes like `database_url`, `stripe_secret_key`, and various environment-specific flags (`environment`, `log_level`) allow for flexible runtime configurations.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The `Settings` class leverages the **Factory Method Pattern** through inheritance from `BaseSettings`. This ensures that the settings are constructed in a consistent manner, with default values provided where necessary. The use of an `.env` file for environment variables is also a common practice to manage configuration securely.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
The `Settings` class acts as a central hub for configuration management within the application. It ensures that all parts of the system can access and rely on consistent, up-to-date settings without hardcoding values directly into the codebase. This promotes decoupling and makes the application more flexible and easier to maintain. The class is typically imported and used in various modules throughout the project to ensure that configuration is properly initialized before any other operations are performed.
