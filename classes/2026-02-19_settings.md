## Class Documentation

### Settings Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for loading application configuration settings from environment variables, ensuring that critical parameters such as API versions, model configurations, and service URLs are properly initialized. This class adheres to the Singleton pattern by inheriting from `BaseSettings`, which helps in managing a single instance of the settings throughout the application.

**Public Interface:**
- **Attributes:** The class defines several attributes representing various configuration settings like `APP_NAME`, `API_VERSION`, `TTS_VOICE`, and others. These are read-only properties that provide access to the environment variables.
  
- **Initialization:** The `Settings` class is initialized with a configuration dictionary, which specifies how environment variables should be loaded (`env_file`, `env_file_encoding`, etc.).

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Singleton Pattern:** By inheriting from `BaseSettings`, this class ensures that only one instance of the settings object exists throughout the application. This pattern is useful for managing shared resources like configuration.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
The `Settings` class acts as a central hub for configuration management, providing easy access to all necessary parameters required by different components of the backend services. It integrates with other classes and modules that need these settings, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of hard-coded values. This approach enhances maintainability and flexibility in managing application configurations dynamically through environment variables.
