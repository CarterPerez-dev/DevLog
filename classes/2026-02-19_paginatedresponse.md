## Class Documentation

### PaginatedResponse Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `PaginatedResponse` class serves as a generic wrapper for paginated API responses, ensuring consistent structure and validation across different data types. It encapsulates essential metadata such as the current page's items, total item count, and pagination details.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`create(cls, items: list[T], total: int, page: int, page_size: int) -> PaginatedResponse[T]`:** A class method that constructs a `PaginatedResponse` instance with the provided parameters. It calculates the total number of pages based on the item count and page size.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Factory Pattern:** The `create` class method acts as a factory, allowing for the creation of instances without exposing the constructor details to the client code.
- **Type Hints and Generic Types (T):** Utilizes Python's type hints and generics to ensure that the response can be used with any data type.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
This class is part of the `schemas` module, which provides validation models for different API responses. It interacts with other schema classes by providing a standardized format for paginated data, facilitating easier integration and handling across various parts of the application.

**State Management Approach:**
The class uses Pydantic's `ConfigDict` to enforce strict field validation (`extra = "forbid"`). This ensures that only specified fields are allowed in the response, maintaining data integrity. The state is managed through instance attributes, which are validated upon instantiation and modification.
