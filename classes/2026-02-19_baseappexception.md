## Class Documentation

### BaseAppException Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `BaseAppException` class serves as a foundational exception for all application-specific errors within the social-media-notes project. It provides a consistent structure for handling exceptions, ensuring that error messages, status codes, and additional metadata are uniformly managed throughout the application.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: This constructor initializes an instance of `BaseAppException`. It accepts a mandatory `message` parameter and optional `status_code` (defaulting to 500) and `extra` metadata as a dictionary.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **None explicitly used**: The class itself does not implement any specific design patterns. However, it adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on handling application-specific exceptions.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
The `BaseAppException` class is integral to the error handling mechanism of the social-media-notes backend architecture. By providing a consistent exception structure, it ensures that all errors are handled uniformly across different modules and services. This helps maintain code consistency and simplifies debugging by standardizing how exceptions are created and propagated.

This base exception class can be extended or used directly in various parts of the application to handle specific error scenarios, ensuring that the overall architecture remains robust and maintainable.
