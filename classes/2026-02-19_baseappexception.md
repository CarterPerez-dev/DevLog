## Class Documentation

### BaseAppException

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `BaseAppException` class serves as a foundational exception handling mechanism for the application, ensuring that all custom exceptions inherit from this base class. This promotes consistency in error handling across the codebase.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500, **kwargs: Any)`**: Initializes the exception with a user-friendly message and an optional HTTP status code. Additional keyword arguments can be passed to store extra information related to the error.

**Design Patterns Used:**
This class does not explicitly use any design patterns but follows best practices for exception handling in Python applications. It ensures that all custom exceptions are properly structured, making it easier to manage and handle errors consistently throughout the application.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`BaseAppException` is a crucial component of the error management architecture. By requiring all custom exceptions to inherit from this base class, it standardizes how errors are reported and managed. This approach enhances maintainability by providing a clear structure for exception handling, ensuring that any new exceptions added to the system will follow the same pattern. Additionally, it facilitates easier logging and debugging since all exceptions will have consistent attributes like `message` and `status_code`.
