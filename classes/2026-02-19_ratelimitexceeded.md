## Class Documentation

### RateLimitExceeded Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `RateLimitExceeded` class is a custom exception designed to handle scenarios where API rate limits are exceeded. This exception provides clear feedback to the application when such limitations are encountered, allowing for appropriate handling and user notifications.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str = "Calm down a little bit...", retry_after: int | None = None, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: This constructor initializes the exception with a custom message, an optional `retry_after` timestamp indicating when the rate limit will be reset, and additional metadata in the form of a dictionary.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **None explicitly used**: The class does not directly implement any design patterns. However, it leverages Python's built-in exception handling mechanism effectively.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
`RateLimitExceeded` is part of the `core.exceptions` module and serves as a specialized exception for rate limit issues. This class ensures that rate limit errors are handled consistently across the application. By inheriting from `BaseAppException`, it integrates seamlessly into existing error handling mechanisms, providing a standardized way to manage exceptions related to API usage limits.

This class is typically used in FastAPI or similar frameworks where rate limiting is enforced, ensuring that API clients receive clear and actionable feedback when they exceed their allowed request rates.
