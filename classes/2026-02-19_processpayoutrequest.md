## Class Documentation

### ProcessPayoutRequest

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ProcessPayoutRequest` class serves as a data model for validating and representing payout requests. It ensures that all necessary fields are provided with correct types and constraints, such as user ID length and amount validity.

**Public Interface:**
- **Fields:**
  - `user_id`: A string representing the user identifier.
  - `amount`: A float indicating the payout amount.
  - `recipient_data`: A dictionary containing additional recipient information.
  
- **Validators:**
  - `validate_no_whitespace`: A class method that strips leading and trailing whitespace from the `user_id` field.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class utilizes Pydantic's `BaseModel` for data validation, which is a common pattern in Python applications to ensure data integrity. No explicit design patterns like factory or observer are used here, but the use of validators can be seen as a form of strategy pattern where different validation logic can be applied.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
This class plays a crucial role in the input validation layer of the application. It is likely part of a larger system that handles payout requests from users or external services. By ensuring that incoming data conforms to expected formats and constraints, it helps maintain robustness and consistency across the application. The `ProcessPayoutRequest` object can be passed to other components such as service handlers or database operations for further processing.
