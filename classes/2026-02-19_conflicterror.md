## Class Documentation

### Documentation for `ConflictError`

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `ConflictError` class is a custom exception subclass designed to handle situations where an operation conflicts with the current state of the application. This ensures that any conflicting operations are properly flagged and handled, maintaining data integrity.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **`__init__(self, message: str, extra: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: Initializes the `ConflictError` exception with a user-friendly error message and optional additional context. The `message` parameter is required to provide a clear description of the conflict, while `extra` allows for passing in any additional information that might be relevant.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **None explicitly used**: This class primarily serves as a custom exception handler without employing specific design patterns like Factory, Observer, or Strategy. It leverages Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`ConflictError` is part of the `exceptions.py` module within the core package of the social-media-notes application. This class is used throughout the application to raise exceptions when operations conflict with existing states, ensuring that such conflicts are properly managed and logged. It integrates seamlessly into the overall error handling mechanism, providing a clear and consistent way to handle state-related errors across different modules.
