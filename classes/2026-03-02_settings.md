## Class Documentation

### Settings

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class serves as a central namespace for various constants, rules, and limits that govern the behavior of different features within the CertGames application. It encapsulates business logic and configuration parameters required by multiple components across the system.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- The class primarily provides access to static attributes representing various limits, thresholds, and constants used throughout the application. There are no public methods; all interactions are through attribute access.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The `Settings` class leverages the **Singleton pattern** implicitly by providing a namespace for shared configuration values. It also uses **Final attributes** to ensure that these settings cannot be modified once set, ensuring consistency and preventing unintended changes.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
- The `Settings` class is part of the core backend module (`/home/yoshi/dev/CertGames-Core/backend/settings.py`). It acts as a central configuration hub, making it easier to manage and update application-wide settings without modifying multiple files.
- It interacts with other classes through static attribute access, ensuring that all components can reference these constants consistently. This design promotes loose coupling between modules while maintaining centralized control over critical configurations.

This class ensures that the CertGames application adheres to predefined rules and limits, contributing to a robust and maintainable codebase.
