## Class Documentation

### Documentation for `Settings` Class

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class serves as a namespace for various configuration settings, constants, and limits used throughout the application. It is structured into nested sub-classes to organize different types of configurations such as business rules, user interactions, and game mechanics.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- The public interface primarily consists of static attributes representing constants and limits. These are accessed via attribute access rather than method calls.
- Example: `Settings.Business.PRACTICE_QUESTIONS_LIMIT`

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Singleton Pattern:** Although not explicitly implemented, the class acts as a singleton by providing global settings that are shared across the application.
- **Factory Pattern:** Not directly used in this class but could be applied to dynamically create different sets of configurations based on context.

**Relationship to Other Classes:**
- The `Settings` class is imported and used extensively throughout the backend codebase, particularly in modules related to user interactions, game logic, and configuration management.
- It provides a centralized point for accessing application-wide constants, ensuring consistency across the application.

**State Management Approach:**
The state of the application is managed by these static attributes. Changes to settings require modifying the class directly or through a dedicated configuration management system if such a system exists in the architecture.

This documentation covers the essential aspects of the `Settings` class, providing clarity on its role and usage within the application.
