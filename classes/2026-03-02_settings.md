## Class Documentation

### Documentation for `Settings` Class

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `Settings` class serves as a main namespace for various business rules, constants, and configurations required by the application. It encapsulates settings related to practice questions, support, leaderboard, daily rewards, contact, equipment history, phishing, terminal, protocol blitz, tests, streaks, milestones, roles, and more.

**Public Interface:**
The class primarily provides a collection of static attributes (constants) for various business rules and configurations. There are no public methods as it is designed to be a namespace for constants only.

```python
class Settings:
    class Business:
        # Various constants related to practice questions, support, leaderboard, etc.
```

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Singleton Pattern:** Although not explicitly implemented, the use of static attributes and constants can be seen as a form of singleton behavior where these settings are shared across the application without needing an instance.
  
**Relationship to Other Classes:**
The `Settings.Business` class is used throughout the application wherever configuration or business rules need to be referenced. It provides a centralized location for all such configurations, making it easier to manage and update them in one place.

**State Management Approach:**
Since this class contains only static attributes (constants), there's no state management involved. The values are immutable once set, ensuring that the application always uses consistent settings across different parts of the codebase.

This documentation covers the key aspects of the `Settings` class, highlighting its role in providing a centralized configuration point for various business rules and constants used throughout the CertGames-Core backend application.
