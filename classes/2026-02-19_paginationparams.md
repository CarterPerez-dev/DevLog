## Class Documentation

### PaginationParams Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `PaginationParams` class is designed to encapsulate pagination parameters for list endpoints, ensuring that only valid page numbers and sizes are accepted. It enforces a clear separation of concerns by handling validation and calculation logic within its methods.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **Fields (`page`, `page_size`)**: These fields represent the current page number and the number of items per page, respectively.
- **Properties (`offset`, `limit`)**:
  - `offset`: Calculates the offset for database queries based on the current page and page size.
  - `limit`: Returns the limit value for database queries.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class leverages Pydantic's `BaseModel` to enforce data validation, ensuring that only valid inputs are accepted. It does not explicitly use any design patterns like Factory or Observer but relies on Field annotations and properties for encapsulation and behavior.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
This class is part of a broader schema definition within the `/schemas/base.py` file, which likely contains other validation models used throughout the application. `PaginationParams` ensures that pagination logic is consistent across various endpoints by providing a standardized way to handle page numbers and sizes, making it easier to integrate with database queries and API responses. Its use promotes clean code practices and helps maintain a uniform approach to handling paginated data in the backend architecture of the `vuemantics` repository.
