## Class Documentation

### CodeSnippet Class Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `CodeSnippet` class represents a code snippet extracted from a source file for analysis purposes. It captures essential metadata such as the repository, file path, language, and specific lines of interest within the file.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **display_name**: Returns a formatted string representing the name of the function or class associated with the snippet.
- **line_count**: Computes the number of lines in the code snippet based on its start and end line positions.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The `CodeSnippet` class does not explicitly use any design patterns. However, it leverages Python's property decorator to encapsulate computed properties (`display_name` and `line_count`), ensuring that these attributes are lazily evaluated and providing a clean interface for accessing the snippet’s metadata.

**How It Fits in the Architecture:**
The `CodeSnippet` class is part of the data model layer within the CodeWorm repository. It serves as a foundational component, providing structured representation of code snippets to higher-level modules responsible for analysis and processing. The class interacts with other models and services through its attributes and properties, facilitating operations such as complexity calculation, documentation extraction, and file path handling.

By encapsulating key metadata and computed values, `CodeSnippet` ensures that the core functionality is decoupled from external dependencies, promoting reusability and maintainability in the broader architecture.
