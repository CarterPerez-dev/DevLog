## Class Documentation

### NoteRepository Documentation

**Class Responsibility and Purpose:**
The `NoteRepository` class is responsible for managing CRUD operations on `Note` entities, specifically focusing on soft deletion and restoration of notes. It provides a clean interface to interact with the database using SQLAlchemy's asynchronous session.

**Public Interface (Key Methods):**
- **get_all**: Retrieves all non-deleted notes optionally filtered by folder.
- **get_root_notes**: Fetches non-deleted notes without a folder.
- **get_deleted**: Recovers soft-deleted notes based on their deletion time.
- **soft_delete**: Soft deletes a single note by setting its `deleted_at` timestamp.
- **restore**: Restores a soft-deleted note by resetting its `deleted_at` to `None`.
- **bulk_soft_delete**: Soft deletes multiple notes by their IDs.

**Design Patterns Used:**
The class leverages the **Repository Pattern**, which abstracts data access and provides a clean interface for interacting with the database. It also uses SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities, specifically asynchronous session handling and SQL expression language to perform bulk operations efficiently.

**How it Fits in the Architecture:**
`NoteRepository` is part of the Data Access Layer (DAL) within the `angelamos-operations` project. It interacts directly with the database through an `AsyncSession`, ensuring that all data access operations are handled asynchronously. This class is designed to be agnostic of the specific implementation details, making it easier to switch between different storage mechanisms if needed. The repository pattern ensures that business logic remains separate from data access concerns, promoting a clean and maintainable architecture.
