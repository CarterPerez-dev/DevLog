## Today I Learned

TIL: I learned about using context windows to analyze surrounding text for educational content. In `SecurityService._is_educational_content`, the function checks if a pattern's context within 50 characters before and after matches keywords like "example" or quotes, indicating it might be part of an explanation rather than malicious code.

```python
pattern_context = content_lower[start : end]
if any(indicator in pattern_context for indicator in ["example", '"', "'"]):
    # Likely educational content
```

This technique helps distinguish between examples and actual attacks.
