## Today I Learned

TIL: In `prepare_training_data`, the function uses stratified sampling with `train_test_split` to ensure class proportions are maintained across splits, and applies SMOTE only on the training set to balance minority classes. This prevents data leakage and maintains dataset integrity.

```python
# Example usage:
split = prepare_training_data(X, y)
```

This pattern is both clever and useful for handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning tasks!
