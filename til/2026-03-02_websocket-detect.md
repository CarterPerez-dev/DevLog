## Source Code

```python
async def websocket_detect(websocket: WebSocket) -> None:
    """
    WebSocket endpoint for real-time wake word detection.
    Send audio chunks as binary, receive JSON detection events.
    """
    await websocket.accept()

    model = service.create_session_model()

    try:
        while True:
            msg = await websocket.receive()

            if msg.get("type") == "websocket.disconnect":
                break

            if "text" in msg:
                if msg["text"] == "reset":
                    model.reset()
                continue

            if "bytes" not in msg:
                continue

            detections = service.process_audio(model, msg["bytes"])

            for detection in detections:
                await websocket.send_json(detection.model_dump())

    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        pass
```

## Today I Learned

TIL: The `websocket_detect` function uses an asynchronous loop to handle WebSocket messages, efficiently processing audio chunks and sending real-time detection results. The `try-except` block catching `WebSocketDisconnect` ensures clean shutdown when clients disconnect, preventing errors.

This pattern elegantly manages real-time communication while maintaining code readability and robustness. 🚀🔍
