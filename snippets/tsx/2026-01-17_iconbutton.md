## Source Code

```tsx
function IconButton(props: IconButtonProps): JSX.Element {
  const [local, rest] = splitProps(props, [
    "icon",
    "onClick",
    "size",
    "variant",
    "ariaLabel",
    "disabled",
    "loading",
    "class",
  ])

  const size = (): Size => local.size ?? "md"
  const variant = (): IconButtonVariant => local.variant ?? "ghost"
  const isDisabled = (): boolean => local.disabled ?? false
  const isLoading = (): boolean => local.loading ?? false

  const handleClick = (): void => {
    if (!isDisabled() && !isLoading() && local.onClick !== undefined) {
      local.onClick()
    }
  }

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      aria-label={local.ariaLabel}
      disabled={isDisabled() || isLoading()}
      onClick={handleClick}
      class={`
        inline-flex items-center justify-center
        transition-all duration-100
        focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange focus:ring-offset-1 focus:ring-offset-black
        ${SIZE_CLASSES[size()]}
        ${VARIANT_CLASSES[variant()]}
        ${(isDisabled() || isLoading()) ? DISABLED_CLASSES : ""}
        ${local.class ?? ""}
      `}
      {...rest}
    >
      <Show
        when={!isLoading()}
        fallback={<Spinner size={size() === "xs" ? "xs" : "sm"} />}
      >
        <span class={ICON_SIZE_CLASSES[size()]}>
          {local.icon}

## Documentation

### Documentation for `IconButton` Component

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `IconButton` component in the provided code is a versatile React button that supports various props such as icon, onClick handler, size, variant, and disabled state. It dynamically applies styles based on these props and handles click events appropriately.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Props Splitting:** The function uses `splitProps` to separate necessary props from the rest.
- **Conditional Styling:** Styles are conditionally applied using ternary operators and class variables like `SIZE_CLASSES`, `VARIANT_CLASSES`, and `DISABLED_CLASSES`.
- **State Handling:** Functions like `size()`, `variant()`, `isDisabled()`, and `isLoading()` determine dynamic properties.
- **Event Handling:** Click events are handled only if the button is not disabled or loading.

**When/Why to Use:**
Use this component when you need a customizable, responsive icon button with support for different sizes, variants, and states. It’s ideal for UI elements that require interactivity and visual feedback.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- **Conditional Rendering:** The `Show` component is used effectively to conditionally render the icon or a spinner based on loading state.
- **Class Names:** Carefully manage class names to ensure consistent styling across different states. Ensure all required classes are defined in your project for this to work seamlessly.

This component encapsulates complex behavior into a reusable and maintainable piece of code, making it easier to update styles and functionality in the future.
