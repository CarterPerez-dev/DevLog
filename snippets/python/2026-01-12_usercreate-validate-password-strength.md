## Documentation

### Documentation for `validate_password_strength`

**Purpose and Behavior**
The function `validate_password_strength` is a class method used as a field validator in the `UserCreate` schema class (located in `v1/backend/app/user/schemas.py`). It ensures that passwords meet certain complexity requirements by checking for at least one uppercase letter and one digit. If these conditions are not met, it raises a `ValueError`.

**Key Implementation Details**
- **Type Hints**: The function takes a string `v` as input and returns the same string if validation passes.
- **Validation Logic**: It uses generator expressions with `any()` to check for uppercase letters and digits. If either condition fails, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.

**When/Why to Use This Code**
This code should be used in scenarios where password strength needs to be enforced during user creation or update operations. By integrating this validator into the schema class, it ensures that any attempt to create or modify a user with a weak password will fail validation and prompt the user to provide a stronger one.

**Patterns and Gotchas**
- **Class Method Decorator**: The `@classmethod` decorator indicates that this method operates on the class rather than an instance. This is useful for schema-level validations.
- **Field Validator Decorator**: The `@field_validator("password")` ensures that validation only occurs when setting the "password" field, making it efficient and targeted.

This pattern helps maintain clean, readable code by centralizing validation logic within the schema class.
