## Documentation

### Documentation for `lifespan` Function

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `lifespan` function manages the startup and shutdown lifecycle of a FastAPI application in an asynchronous context. It initializes database connections, Redis clients, and ensures necessary tables exist before starting the application. During shutdown, it gracefully closes all resources.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Initialization:** The function logs initialization steps for the database and Redis.
- **Error Handling:** Uses a try-except block to catch and log any exceptions during startup.
- **Resource Management:** Utilizes `yield` within an asynchronous context manager (`@asynccontextmanager`) to ensure resources are properly closed on shutdown.

**When/Why to Use:**
This function is essential for managing application lifecycle events, ensuring that database connections and Redis clients are initialized before the application starts and cleaned up after it stops. It's particularly useful in production environments where resource management is critical.

**Patterns/Gotchas:**
- **Asynchronous Context Management:** The use of `@asynccontextmanager` ensures that resources are properly managed during startup and shutdown.
- **Type Hints:** The function uses type hints for better code clarity, especially with the `FastAPI` parameter.
- **Error Logging:** Comprehensive error logging helps in diagnosing issues during application initialization or shutdown.
