### Documentation for `get_by_user` Method

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `get_by_user` method retrieves a paginated list of `JobApplication` objects associated with a specific user from the database. It uses SQLAlchemy's asynchronous session to execute a query that filters by `user_id`, orders by `created_at` in descending order, and applies pagination using `skip` and `limit`.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:** 
  - `cls`: The class itself (used for calling class methods).
  - `session`: An `AsyncSession` object for database operations.
  - `user_id`: A `UUID` representing the user's ID.
  - `skip`: Number of items to skip before starting to collect results. Default is `0`.
  - `limit`: Maximum number of results to return. Default is `50`.

- **Return Type:** 
  Returns a list of `JobApplication` objects.

**When/Why to Use This Code:**
This method should be used when you need to fetch job applications for a specific user, with support for pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. It ensures that the most recent applications are shown first and can be easily filtered by user ID.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- **Type Hints:** The function uses type hints to specify expected input types (`AsyncSession`, `UUID`, `Sequence[JobApplication]`).
- **Pagination:** The use of `skip` and `limit` ensures efficient querying, especially for large datasets.
- **SQLAlchemy Query:** The query construction is done using SQLAlchemy's `select` and `where` methods, which are powerful but require careful handling to avoid SQL injection.

This method leverages Python’s async capabilities and SQLAlchemy for database operations, making it suitable for modern asynchronous web applications.
