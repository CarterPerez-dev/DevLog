## Documentation

### Documentation for `find_by_user` Method

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `find_by_user` method is an asynchronous class method in the `Upload` class that retrieves a list of uploads associated with a specific user, applying optional filters such as file type, status, and sort criteria. It ensures the database table exists before executing the query.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:** Accepts various filters like `file_type`, `status`, and sorting options.
- **Dynamic Query Construction:** Constructs SQL queries dynamically based on provided parameters to filter uploads.
- **Validation and Sanitization:** Validates sort fields and order to prevent SQL injection.
- **Database Interaction:** Uses a database connection object (`database.db`) for executing the query.

**When/Why to Use:**
Use this method when you need to fetch user-specific uploads with optional filtering. It's particularly useful in scenarios where users can search or view their files based on various criteria, ensuring flexibility and security.

**Patterns/Gotchas:**
- **Dynamic Query Construction:** While flexible, ensure that all parameters are properly validated to avoid SQL injection.
- **Default Values:** Default values for `sort_by` and `sort_order` provide convenience but should be used carefully to maintain consistency.
