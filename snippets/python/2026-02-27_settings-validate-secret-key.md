### Documentation for `validate_secret_key`

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The function `validate_secret_key` is a class method that checks if the provided secret key is the default one (`"dev-secret-key"`). If it detects that the environment is set to "production," it issues a warning about using an insecure default secret key. Otherwise, it returns the original value.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- The function takes three parameters: `cls` (the class), `v` (the secret key as a string), and `info` (an object containing validation information).
- It uses Python's built-in `warnings.warn` to issue a warning message.
- The condition checks if the environment is "production" and the provided secret key matches the default value.

**When/Why to Use This Code:**
This function should be used in configurations where sensitive data like secret keys are being validated. Specifically, it helps prevent security issues by ensuring that default development keys are not accidentally used in production environments.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- **Context Manager:** While this function is a method, it does not use context managers directly; however, understanding how to integrate such checks within configuration management can be beneficial.
- **Type Hints:** The use of type hints (`v: str`, `info: ValidationInfo`) makes the code more readable and maintainable. Ensure that `ValidationInfo` is properly defined elsewhere in your codebase.
- **Warning Mechanism:** This approach provides a runtime check but does not enforce any strict validation at compile time or deployment stages. Consider additional checks or automated tests to ensure security practices are followed consistently.
