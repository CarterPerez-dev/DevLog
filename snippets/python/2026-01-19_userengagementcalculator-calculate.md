## Documentation

### Documentation for `calculate_engagement_score`

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The function `calculate_engagement_score` computes a user's engagement score based on their activity metrics, such as login frequency, test attempts, achievements, and level progression. It returns a tuple containing the calculated score (0-100) and a dictionary of factors contributing to the score.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- The function uses if-elif statements to categorize user activities into different score ranges.
- It calculates `days_since_login` by subtracting the user's last login date from today, considering timezone adjustments.
- Factors like `login_frequency`, `test_activity`, `achievement_progress`, and `level_progression` are stored in a dictionary.

**When/Why to Use:**
This function is ideal for scenarios where you need to assess user engagement levels within an application. It can be used by administrators or analytics tools to monitor and improve user retention strategies based on activity patterns.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- The use of `UTC` timezone ensures accurate date calculations.
- The function handles cases where certain attributes might not be present, providing default values (e.g., 0 for missing login dates).
- The scoring system is designed to reward consistent and frequent user activities, which can help in identifying highly engaged users.
