## Documentation

### Documentation for `_should_skip_function`

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The function `CodeAnalyzer._should_skip_function` determines whether a given function should be skipped during analysis based on several criteria:
- Functions starting with an underscore but not double underscores.
- Specific function names like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `main`, `setUp`, and `tearDown`.
- Line count of the function, compared against settings defined in `self.settings`.

**Key Implementation Details:**
1. **Random Skip Check:** Functions starting with a single underscore have a 30% chance of being skipped.
2. **Name-Based Skips:** Certain predefined names are always skipped.
3. **Line Count Validation:** The number of lines is checked against minimum and maximum settings.

**When/Why to Use:**
This function is used in code analysis tools where certain functions need to be excluded from the analysis process. It helps in focusing on relevant parts of the codebase, reducing noise and improving efficiency.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- The random skip check introduces variability; ensure this behavior aligns with your analysis requirements.
- Be cautious when modifying `skip_names` as it directly impacts which functions are skipped without user configuration.
- Line count validation relies on settings that must be properly configured to avoid skipping or including too many functions.
