## Documentation

### Documentation for `formatAge` Function

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `formatAge` function takes a `time.Time` object representing the creation time of an entity and returns a human-readable string indicating how long ago that entity was created. It categorizes the age into "just now," hours, days, weeks, months, or years.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- The function first checks if the input time is zero (unknown). If so, it returns `"unknown"`.
- It calculates the duration since the creation time using `time.Since` and converts this to days.
- Depending on the number of days, it formats the age into hours, days, weeks, months, or years.

**When/Why to Use:**
This function is useful for displaying timestamps in a user-friendly manner, especially when dealing with recent events. It can be used in logs, UIs, or any context where you need to convey time intervals succinctly.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- The function uses integer division to categorize the age into weeks, months, and years, which is a common Go idiom for simplifying calculations.
- Be cautious with edge cases; for example, if `created` is exactly one day old, it will be categorized as "1d ago" instead of "24h ago."
- Ensure that the input time is correctly initialized to avoid unexpected behavior.
