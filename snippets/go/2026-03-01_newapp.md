### Documentation for `NewApp` Function

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `NewApp` function initializes a new instance of the application, setting up various components such as tabs, splash screen, dashboard, Docker tab, audit tab, and configuration. It returns an `App` struct with these components pre-configured.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- The function loads default configuration using `config.Load(config.DefaultPath())`, ignoring any potential errors.
- It initializes the application state by setting the active tab to `TabDashboard`, showing a splash screen, and creating instances of various UI components like `Splash`, `Dashboard`, `DockerTab`, and `AuditTab`.
- The configuration (`cfg`) is stored in the returned `App` struct.

**When/Why to Use This Code:**
This function should be called at application startup to initialize all necessary components. It ensures that the application has a consistent initial state, including default settings for tabs and splash screen visibility.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- **Error Handling:** The function ignores any errors returned by `config.Load`, which might lead to silent failures if configuration loading fails.
- **Configuration Management:** The configuration is loaded once at startup. If the configuration needs to be updated during runtime, additional mechanisms should be implemented.
- **Initialization Order:** The order of initialization for components (e.g., splash screen before dashboard) follows a specific sequence that may need adjustment based on application requirements.

This function encapsulates the setup logic in one place, making it easier to manage and maintain.
