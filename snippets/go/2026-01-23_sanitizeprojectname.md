			result.WriteRune(r)
		} else {
			result.WriteRune('-')
		}

		if i == 0 && !(r >= 'a' && r <= 'z') && !(r >= '0' && r <= '9') {

## Documentation

### Documentation for `sanitizeProjectName` Function

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The `sanitizeProjectName` function takes a string input representing a project name, converts it to lowercase, replaces dots with hyphens, and then sanitizes the remaining characters. It ensures that only letters (a-z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed. If the first character is invalid, it prepends 'p-' to the sanitized string. Any leading or trailing hyphens or underscores are removed. If the result is empty after sanitization, it returns "project".

**Key Implementation Details:**
1. **Lowercase Conversion:** The input name is converted to lowercase using `strings.ToLower`.
2. **Character Replacement and Validation:** A loop iterates through each character of the name, replacing invalid characters with hyphens.
3. **Initial Character Check:** If the first character is invalid, the string is reset and prepended with 'p-'.
4. **Trimming:** Leading and trailing hyphens or underscores are removed using `strings.Trim`.

**When/Why to Use:**
This function is useful for ensuring consistent project naming conventions in systems where project names need to follow specific formatting rules. It can be used when integrating user input into a system that requires standardized project identifiers.

**Patterns/Gotchas:**
- **Error Handling:** The function does not explicitly handle errors, relying on the robustness of Go's standard library functions.
- **Performance Considerations:** While efficient for most use cases, the function may need optimization if applied to very long strings or in high-throughput scenarios.
