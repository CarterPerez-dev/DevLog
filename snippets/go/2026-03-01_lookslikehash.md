## Source Code

```go
func looksLikeHash(name string) bool {
	if len(name) < 32 {
		return false
	}
	for _, c := range name {
		if !((c >= '0' && c <= '9') || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'f')) {

### Documentation for `looksLikeHash` Function

**Purpose and Behavior:**
The function `looksLikeHash` checks if a given string `name` resembles a hexadecimal hash by ensuring it is at least 32 characters long and contains only valid hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f).

**Key Implementation Details:**
1. **Length Check:** The function first verifies that the input string `name` has a length of at least 32 characters.
2. **Character Validation:** It iterates over each character in the string using a range loop and checks if it is either a digit (0-9) or a lowercase hexadecimal letter (a-f).

**When/Why to Use This Code:**
Use this function when you need to validate user input that should represent a hexadecimal hash. For instance, in a Docker container management system where hashes are used for identifying images or layers.

**Patterns and Gotchas:**
- **Error Handling:** The function does not return an error; it returns a boolean value indicating whether the string looks like a valid hash.
- **Case Sensitivity:** The function only checks lowercase hexadecimal characters. Ensure that your input is appropriately formatted if you expect uppercase letters as well.
- **Performance Considerations:** While simple, this function performs a linear scan of the input string, which could be optimized for very large strings.

This function ensures robust validation of hash-like strings in scenarios where such validation is critical to maintain data integrity.
