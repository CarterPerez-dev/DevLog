## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
- The `FractalInfo` component now explicitly types the `Component` import from Solid.js as a type, rather than an interface.
- Added type annotations to the destructuring of `props.parameters.juliaConstant`.
- Improved readability and consistency by adding whitespace around operators in conditional expressions.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
- The author likely wanted to ensure type safety and clarity. Explicitly typing imports is a common practice in TypeScript projects to avoid runtime errors.
- Adding type annotations for destructuring helps prevent potential issues with missing or unexpected properties in `props.parameters.juliaConstant`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- No functional changes were introduced; the component still renders fractal metadata correctly.
- The added type safety could help catch bugs earlier during development.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- While adding types is generally beneficial, overuse can clutter code. Ensure that the additional typing does not make the code harder to read or understand.
- The minor whitespace changes do not impact functionality but should be consistent with existing coding standards in the project.

Overall, these changes are likely part of a broader effort to improve type safety and maintainability without altering the component's behavior.
