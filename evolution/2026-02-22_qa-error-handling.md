### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code changes involve modifying several test methods in `qa_error_handling.py`. Specifically, the paths and parameters passed to HTTP POST requests have been simplified by removing unnecessary whitespace around commas and parentheses.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely aim to clean up the code for better readability and maintainability. The removal of extra spaces is a common practice in Python to adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines, which can improve code consistency and reduce potential errors related to syntax.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the tests remains unchanged. The test methods still make HTTP POST requests with the same parameters as before. The assertions for expected status codes and error messages also remain intact.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While these changes are minor, they could potentially introduce subtle bugs if not applied consistently across similar codebases. Ensuring that all related files have been updated in a similar manner would mitigate this risk. Additionally, maintaining consistent coding standards can help prevent issues down the line.

Overall, these changes are likely part of a broader effort to clean up and standardize the codebase while preserving functionality.
