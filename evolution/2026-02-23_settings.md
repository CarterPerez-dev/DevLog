## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `config/settings.py` was added to the repository, containing a class `Settings` derived from `BaseSettings` provided by `pydantic_settings`. The file includes default values for various application settings and environment-specific configurations. It also specifies how these settings are loaded from an `.env` file.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration management using Pydantic, which provides a robust way to handle environment variables and ensure type safety. The use of `BaseSettings` allows for automatic validation and parsing of environment variables into Python objects.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of this settings class will affect how the application reads and uses its configurations. Settings like database URLs, Stripe API keys, logging levels, and payout amounts are now dynamically loaded from an `.env` file, making it easier to manage different environments (e.g., development, production).

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** Storing sensitive information such as `stripe_secret_key` in a `.env` file should be carefully managed. Ensure the file is not committed to version control and has appropriate permissions.
- **Environment Mismatch:** If the environment variable names do not match those specified in the `Settings` class, the application may fail to load correct settings.
- **Default Values:** While default values are provided, they might need adjustment based on specific requirements or environments.

Overall, this change enhances configuration management and flexibility but requires careful handling of sensitive data.
