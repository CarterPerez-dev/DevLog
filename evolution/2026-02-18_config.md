### Change Analysis for `config.py`

**What was Changed:**
A new file named `config.py` was added, containing a class `Settings` derived from `BaseSettings`. This class uses Pydantic settings to load configuration parameters from an environment file and sets default values. The file includes various application-specific configurations such as API keys, database URLs, queue sizes, and log paths.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize the application's configuration in a structured manner using Pydantic for easy validation and management of environment variables. This approach enhances maintainability and flexibility by allowing dynamic changes without modifying code directly.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The new `Settings` class will be used throughout the application to access configuration parameters, ensuring consistency and ease of updating settings via environment files. It impacts how the application interacts with its database, queues, and logging mechanisms, making these interactions more configurable and easier to manage.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** The `api_key` is stored as a plain string in the configuration file. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
- **Environment Dependency:** The default values might not be suitable for all environments (e.g., production vs development). Ensure proper overrides are in place.
- **Performance Impact:** The use of asynchronous database connections (`postgresql+asyncpg`) should be validated to ensure it does not introduce performance bottlenecks.

Overall, this change improves the application's configuration management and is a positive step towards better code organization.
