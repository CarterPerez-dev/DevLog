## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** 
A new file `achievement.types.ts` was added to the repository, introducing a typescript definition for achievement IDs and an interface for achievements. The file also includes a record of predefined achievements with their details.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize and standardize achievement definitions within the application. By defining constants and interfaces, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand. This approach ensures that all achievements are consistently represented across the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these types and data structures will affect how achievements are handled in the application. Developers can now easily reference achievement IDs and their properties without hardcoding values, reducing the risk of errors and improving code readability.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is likely intended to improve code quality and maintainability, there could be risks if not all parts of the application are updated to use these new definitions. Additionally, any changes to achievement data (e.g., adding a new achievement) would require updates in multiple places, which could introduce bugs if not managed carefully.

Overall, this change is beneficial for the long-term health and scalability of the codebase.
