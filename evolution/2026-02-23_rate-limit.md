### Change Analysis for Commit 4d33b24a

**What was changed:**
The change involved removing the `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` comment from a line that imports the `jwt` module from the `jose` package. Specifically, this is on line 3 of the file `backend/core/rate_limit.py`.

**Why it was likely changed:**
This removal suggests an intention to address or suppress a type hinting issue related to the import statement for `jwt`. The comment `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` is often used when there's a known issue with type checking that cannot be resolved directly. By removing this, the developer may have fixed the underlying issue or decided it was no longer necessary.

**Impact on behavior:**
The removal of the type hinting suppression should not impact the runtime behavior of the code. The `jwt` module will still be imported and used as before. However, the IDE or static type checker (e.g., mypy) might now raise an error if it cannot resolve the import.

**Risks or concerns:**
- If there is no longer a valid reason to suppress the type hinting issue, this change could lead to unnecessary errors in development environments.
- If the `jwt` module was incorrectly imported due to a previous issue, removing the suppression might reveal other underlying issues that need addressing.

Overall, while this change seems minor, it's important to ensure there are no lingering import or type checking issues.
