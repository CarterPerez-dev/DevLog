## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code changes primarily involve adding spaces around the `=` signs in data class definitions and method parameters, and simplifying tuple creation by removing unnecessary parentheses.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guide, which recommends consistent use of whitespace. The removal of redundant parentheses in tuple creation is a minor optimization that aligns with modern coding practices for clarity and conciseness.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged. The data classes `PeelLayer` and `PeelResult`, as well as the method `peel()`, continue to function identically, maintaining their original logic and structure.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks introduced by this change. However, it’s important to ensure that all other parts of the codebase consistently follow PEP 8 guidelines for a uniform coding style. Additionally, while minor, such changes can sometimes introduce subtle bugs if not thoroughly tested, especially in complex projects.

Overall, these changes improve readability and maintainability without altering functionality.
