### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/assistant/facets/angela/types/angela.types.ts`, lines 63 to 65 were modified. The `porcupine` object, which contained properties like `accessKey`, `keywordPath`, `modelPath`, and `sensitivity`, was replaced with a new `wakeWord` object containing `endpoint` and `threshold`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a shift in the wake word detection mechanism from Porcupine to another service. The new properties suggest that the system now uses an endpoint URL for wake word detection, possibly integrating with a cloud-based or external service.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of Angela's assistant will be impacted by this change. Specifically, the way wake words are detected and processed has changed. This could affect how the assistant responds to user commands, potentially requiring adjustments in the backend logic that handles wake word detection.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency on External Service:** The introduction of an `endpoint` suggests a dependency on an external service, which may introduce latency or availability issues.
- **Security Risks:** Exposing sensitive information like access keys and model paths could be risky. Ensure that the new endpoint is secure and properly configured.

Overall, this change likely represents a significant refactoring to improve wake word detection capabilities, but it comes with potential risks related to external dependencies and security.
