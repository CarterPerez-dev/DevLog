Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `app/config.py` file, the line 25-27 block of code that defined the `database_url` setting has been simplified to a single line.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims for cleaner and more concise configuration management. By removing unnecessary whitespace and parentheses, the code becomes easier to read and maintain without altering its functionality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged as the `database_url` setting still points to the same PostgreSQL database with the same credentials (`vigil:changeme@localhost:5432/angelusvigil`). The configuration continues to direct the application to use the specified database URL for storing threat detection data.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Readability:** While the change improves readability, it might slightly reduce the ease of understanding the initial intent behind the configuration.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that this change is applied consistently across all similar configurations in the project to maintain uniformity.

This change is part of a larger feature release (Phase 1) and does not introduce any significant risks.
