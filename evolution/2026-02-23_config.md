Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code added new settings classes for `DocumentationSettings`, `RedisSettings`, and `DashboardSettings`. The `ScheduleSettings` class had its `min_commits_per_day` and `max_commits_per_day` fields updated to allow a wider range of values (1-500 instead of 1-50).

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes were likely made to enhance the flexibility and functionality of CodeWorm. The expanded commit scheduling range allows for more granular control over the frequency of commits, which can be useful in various testing or simulation scenarios. Adding documentation settings enables better management of generated documentation types and their distribution. Redis and dashboard settings support the integration of a web dashboard with real-time stats and logs.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The commit scheduling behavior will now allow for more frequent commits.
- Documentation generation is now configurable, ensuring diverse and relevant content.
- The addition of Redis and Dashboard settings supports monitoring and interaction with CodeWorm via a web interface.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- The increased range of `min_commits_per_day` and `max_commits_per_day` could lead to excessive commit activity if not carefully managed.
- Configuring the dashboard and Redis might introduce complexity, requiring careful setup to avoid issues with connectivity or performance.
