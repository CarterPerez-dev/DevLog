## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed**: A new file `config.py` was added to the project, containing a class `Settings` derived from `BaseSettings`. This class is configured with various environment variables and application settings. Additionally, constants like `API_PREFIX`, `ANGELA_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and an `OPENAPI_TAGS` list are defined.

**Why it Was Likely Changed**: The addition of this configuration file likely aims to centralize all the application's settings in one place for easier management and modification. This follows best practices in Python development, where environment-specific configurations can be easily managed using Pydantic Settings.

**Impact on Behavior**: The new `Settings` class will load values from a `.env` file, making it easy to configure the application without hardcoding these values directly into the code. This impacts how the application initializes and operates, ensuring that settings like API version, TTS voice, and wake word models are dynamically loaded.

**Risks or Concerns**: While this change is beneficial for configuration management, there's a risk if the `.env` file is not properly set up or if environment variables are missing. This could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, ensuring that all necessary settings are included in the `.env` file and correctly referenced by the application will be crucial.

Overall, this change enhances the project’s maintainability and flexibility while introducing a minor risk related to configuration management.
