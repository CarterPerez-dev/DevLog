### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `backend/config.py`, the values for several audit penalties have been adjusted:
- `AUDIT_PENALTY_TOO_SHORT` increased from 30 to 35.
- `AUDIT_PENALTY_LOW_DIVERSITY` increased from 40 to 45.
- `AUDIT_PENALTY_CONSECUTIVE_REPEATS` increased from 35 to 40.
- `AUDIT_PENALTY_HIGH_GIBBERISH` increased from 25 to 30.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely reflect a refined understanding of the audit criteria. Increasing penalty values could indicate that the system now considers these issues more severe, or that the thresholds were previously set too leniently and need adjustment for better accuracy in audits.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The increased penalties will result in stricter scoring for audits. Documents with short text, low diversity, consecutive repeats, or high gibberish content will be penalized more heavily, potentially affecting the overall audit score and pass/fail threshold.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Consistency:** Ensure that these new penalty values are consistent across all audit processes.
- **User Feedback:** Users might receive stricter feedback, which could lead to confusion if not properly communicated.
- **Impact on Pass Rate:** The pass rate for audits may decrease due to the increased penalties, impacting user satisfaction and system performance metrics.

Overall, this change likely aims to improve the quality of documents being audited by making the scoring more stringent.
