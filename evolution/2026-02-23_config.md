### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The `frontend/src/config.ts` file was modified to add new API endpoints and corresponding query keys for bulk operations, as well as a new endpoint for downloading uploads.

- **Endpoints Added:**
  - `DOWNLOAD`: Allows downloading an upload by ID.
  - `BULK_UPLOAD`: Provides the base URL for bulk upload operations.
  - `BATCH` and `BATCHES`: New endpoints to manage batches of uploads.

- **Query Keys Updated:**
  - Added new keys for batch-related queries, such as `BATCHES`, `BATCH`, and `METADATA`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely support the introduction or enhancement of a bulk upload feature in the application. The addition of these endpoints and query keys suggests that the system now supports more granular control over uploads, including downloading individual files, managing batches, and performing bulk operations.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change will enable users to perform bulk operations like uploading multiple files at once or managing groups of uploads through batch IDs. The new `DOWNLOAD` endpoint allows direct file downloads by ID, enhancing user experience.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** Direct download URLs could pose security risks if not properly managed.
- **API Complexity:** Adding more endpoints and query keys might increase the complexity of API usage for developers.
- **Performance Impact:** Bulk operations could potentially impact server performance if not optimized.
