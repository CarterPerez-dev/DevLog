### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new `config.py` file in the `backend/app` directory, which contains application settings and configuration using Pydantic models. The file includes environment-specific variables like database URLs, secret keys, CORS origins, and rate limits.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize all application configurations in one place for easier management and maintainability. Using Pydantic ensures type safety and validation of settings loaded from an `.env` file, which is a common practice in modern Python applications.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `Settings` class with various configuration options will affect how the application interacts with its environment. For instance, database connection details, CORS policies, and rate limits are now defined here, influencing the application's security and performance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** Hardcoded secrets like `SECRET_KEY` should be managed securely.
- **Environment Mismatch:** The `validate_production_settings` method enforces constraints in production but could lead to issues if not properly configured.
- **Cache Dependency:** Using `lru_cache` for `get_settings()` might cause stale settings if the environment changes unexpectedly.

Overall, this change enhances configuration management and security, but careful handling of secrets and validation checks is crucial.
