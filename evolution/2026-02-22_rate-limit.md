### Change Analysis for Commit 617dba39

**What was Changed:**
The year in the copyright notice at the top of `rate_limit.py` was updated from `2025` to `2026`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely due to a routine update of the copyright year, possibly as part of an automated script or manual maintenance. Updating the year ensures that the code's metadata accurately reflects the current year.

**Impact on Behavior:**
There is no impact on the behavior or functionality of the `rate_limit.py` file itself since this change only affects the header comment. However, it may affect how tools like linters or static analyzers interpret the file if they rely on copyright dates for certain checks.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Documentation Consistency:** Ensure that all other files in the repository are updated to reflect the correct year.
- **Automated Tools:** Verify that any automated tools used by the team (e.g., linters, version control hooks) handle this change correctly without causing false positives or errors.

Overall, this is a minor and non-functional update with minimal risk.
