Message: refactor(domains): migrate small domain interfaces to Zod schemas

Convert newsletter, onboarding, daily, leaderboard, and achievement
domains from manual TypeScript interfaces + manual type guards to
Zod schemas + Zod-wrapped guards (Task 2 of Zod migration).

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 1 and 15 were updated to reflect the current year, and the file now imports `z` from 'zod'. The code has been refactored to use Zod schemas for validation and type inference. Manual interfaces have been replaced with Zod schemas, and corresponding type guards are wrapped in Zod.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is part of a larger effort to migrate domain logic to Zod schemas, likely to improve type safety, validation, and consistency across the application. Using Zod also simplifies handling complex data structures and provides better error messages during runtime.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains largely unchanged as the underlying logic for managing user onboarding steps is preserved. However, the new schema-based approach ensures that any incoming data conforms to expected formats, potentially reducing bugs related to incorrect or malformed input.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a risk of introducing subtle bugs if the Zod schemas do not fully capture all edge cases present in the original interfaces. Additionally, developers need to ensure that existing validation logic and type guards are correctly adapted to work with Zod. Care must be taken to maintain backward compatibility during this transition.
