### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
- The line `for i in range(50):` was modified to `for _i in range(50):`, and the key used in the `algo.check()` method call was changed from `f"multi_key"` to `"multi_key"`.
- The import statement for `time` was removed.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
- The removal of the unused import `import time` is likely a clean-up task, ensuring the codebase remains tidy.
- Changing the key in the `algo.check()` method call might be due to a requirement or test case update where the key format has been simplified. This could indicate that the key now needs to be a simple string rather than an f-string.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The loop will still iterate 50 times, but it uses `_i` as the loop variable instead of `i`. This is likely just a renaming for clarity or personal preference.
- Using `"multi_key"` directly in place of `f"multi_key"` simplifies the test case and ensures that the key is treated as a string literal.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- The removal of `time` might be unnecessary if it was not used elsewhere. Ensure no other parts of the code depend on this import.
- Simplifying the key to a string could potentially affect tests where the exact format of the key matters, though in this context, it seems to be a minor change.

Overall, these changes appear to be clean-up and refinement efforts without significant impact on functionality.
