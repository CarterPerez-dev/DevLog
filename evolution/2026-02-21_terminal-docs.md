### Change Analysis for Commit `fe44f45e`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `terminal_docs.py`, was added to the backend API documentation directory. This file defines detailed OpenAPI specifications for several endpoints related to the Terminal Takedown game.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to enhance the user experience and ensure that developers have clear guidelines on how to interact with the new game features. By documenting these endpoints, the team can facilitate easier integration of the game into the application and provide a better understanding of its functionalities.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these documentation files will improve the clarity and usability of the API for both internal development and external integrations. Users will be able to understand the expected inputs and outputs more easily, leading to fewer errors and smoother integration processes.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the new documentation is beneficial, there is a risk that the detailed descriptions might not be fully implemented in the backend code. Ensuring consistency between the documented endpoints and actual implementation is crucial to avoid bugs and inconsistencies. Additionally, maintaining these documents as the API evolves will be important to keep them relevant.

Overall, this change enhances the project's documentation but requires careful verification of its implementation.
