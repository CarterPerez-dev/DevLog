### Change Analysis for `output.py`

**What was Changed:**
Line 24, specifically the removal of a single line of code that defined the `RECORD_COLORS` dictionary.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates an intention to remove color coding for DNS record types. The comment above suggests this might be part of addressing issue 77 in GolangCI, possibly due to changes in requirements or preferences for output formatting.

**Impact on Behavior:**
Without the `RECORD_COLORS` dictionary, any code that relies on color-coding DNS record types will no longer function as intended. This could affect the visual presentation and readability of the output, making it harder to distinguish between different record types (e.g., A records).

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Visual Clarity:** Users might find the output less readable without color coding.
- **Dependent Code:** Other parts of the project that depend on these colors may need updates.
- **Testing:** Ensure that tests covering the output functionality are updated to reflect this change.

This modification is likely a step towards refactoring or addressing specific feedback, but it should be verified that all dependent components are appropriately adjusted.
