### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** A new file `test_config_ml.py` was added to the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/tests` directory. This file contains five test functions that assert various settings from the `app.config.settings` module, ensuring default values are correctly configured.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:** The addition of this test file likely aims to improve code quality and maintainability by verifying configuration settings at runtime. This is common practice in software development to ensure that application defaults behave as expected without manual intervention.

**Impact on Behavior:** These tests will now run automatically whenever the project's test suite is executed, providing immediate feedback if any default values are altered or if new configurations are introduced. This helps catch issues early and ensures consistency across different environments.

**Risks or Concerns:** While this change introduces valuable automated checks, it assumes that `settings` contains all necessary configuration options. If future changes to the settings module are not reflected in these tests, they may become stale and provide false confidence. Additionally, if the test suite is run in an environment where some paths might differ (e.g., different MLflow tracking URI), this could lead to failures unless properly handled.

Overall, this change enhances the project's testing framework and should be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains relevant.
