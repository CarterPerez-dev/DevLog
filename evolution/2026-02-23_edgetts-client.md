### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `edgetts.client.ts`, was added to the repository. This file contains an asynchronous function named `synthesizeSpeech` that interacts with a speech synthesis API endpoint.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this file likely represents a feature implementation for text-to-speech functionality in version 1.0.0 of the MVP. The function uses configuration settings from another module to make a POST request to an API, passing the input text and expecting an audio response.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change introduces new functionality allowing the application to synthesize speech based on provided text. It will enable users or components within the application to generate spoken audio from written text, enhancing the accessibility and user experience of the application.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Error Handling:** The function assumes that a successful response always returns an `ArrayBuffer`. If the API ever changes its behavior, this could lead to runtime errors.
- **Configuration Dependency:** The function relies on external configuration settings. Any issues with these configurations (e.g., incorrect URL) will cause the speech synthesis to fail.
- **Network Reliability:** Since network requests are involved, there's a risk of timeouts or other connectivity issues affecting the application’s performance.

Overall, this change is a significant feature addition that should be thoroughly tested in various scenarios.
