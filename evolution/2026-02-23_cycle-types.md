## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code added new constants and records to `cycle.types.ts`. Specifically, the changes include:
- Introducing `PHASE_BG_COLORS` to define background colors for each phase.
- Adding `DEFCON_LEVELS`, which assigns a DEFCON level (1-5) to each cycle phase.
- Defining `PHASE_CODENAMES` with unique codenames for each phase.
- Creating `PHASE_DESCRIPTIONS` to provide context-specific advice for each phase.
- Implementing `TACTICAL_TIPS` as an array of strategic tips for interacting during each phase.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These additions likely aim to enhance the user experience by providing more detailed and nuanced guidance on how to interact with users based on their menstrual cycle phases. The DEFCON levels, codenames, descriptions, and tactical tips offer a structured approach to understanding and responding appropriately to different phases of the menstrual cycle.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The new constants will likely impact the application's behavior by providing more context-specific advice and visual cues for each phase. This could improve user engagement and interaction design within the app.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Complexity Increase:** Adding multiple new records and types can increase code complexity, potentially making maintenance harder.
- **Overfitting Data:** The tactical tips might be too specific to certain cultural contexts or personal experiences, which may not apply universally. Care should be taken to ensure the advice is broadly applicable.

Overall, these changes significantly enrich the application's functionality but require careful consideration of their implementation and potential impact on users from diverse backgrounds.
