### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
- The `porcupine` configuration object was removed and replaced with a new `wakeWord` object.
- The `saveApiKey` function was modified to accept only the `'elevenlabs'` key, effectively removing support for saving Picovoice API keys.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
- This change likely reflects a shift in the assistant's wake word functionality. The removal of `porcupine` and introduction of `wakeWord` suggests a transition to using a different wake word detection service.
- Simplifying the key handling by removing support for Picovoice might indicate that this service is no longer needed or has been deprecated.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- Users will now interact with Angela via a new endpoint specified in `saveApiKey`.
- The sensitivity parameter was moved to the `wakeWord` object, which may affect how accurately the wake word is detected.
- Support for saving Picovoice API keys is removed, potentially breaking existing configurations that relied on this service.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- Users who previously configured Picovoice might need to update their settings.
- The new endpoint specified in `saveApiKey` should be tested thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- Removing support for a service without providing an alternative could impact users who were relying on that functionality.
