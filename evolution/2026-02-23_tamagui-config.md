### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `red-recon/src/theme/tamagui.config.ts`, the interFont configuration for Tamagui was modified. Specifically, the font sizes and weights were adjusted. New size values were added (8: 34, 9: 40) and a new weight value (7: '700') was introduced. Additionally, letter spacing adjustments were made to better control text appearance.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely aim to refine the typography for a more consistent or visually appealing user experience. The addition of specific sizes and weights could be part of a design update or responsive design strategy. Adjusting letter spacing might address readability issues at certain font sizes.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is primarily visual, affecting how text appears across different sizes and weights in the application. Users may notice slight changes in font rendering, particularly at larger sizes where the new values are applied.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Consistency:** The introduction of new size and weight values might affect existing design consistency if not carefully managed.
- **Performance:** While unlikely, frequent adjustments to typography could impact performance if not optimized.
- **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing across different devices and screen sizes to validate the changes.

This change is likely a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix or refactor.
