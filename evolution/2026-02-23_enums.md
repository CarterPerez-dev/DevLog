### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `enums.py` was added to the `src/stripe_referral/config/` directory, introducing 87 lines of code defining various enums. These enums cover status values (PayoutStatus, ReferralCodeStatus, ReferralTrackingStatus), adapter types (AdapterType), reward types (RewardType), currency codes (CurrencyCode), and logging levels (LogLevel).

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize and standardize magic strings used throughout the application. By defining these as enums, the code becomes more maintainable, readable, and less prone to errors related to string typos or inconsistencies.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these enums does not directly impact existing behavior but ensures that all status values, adapter types, reward types, currency codes, and logging levels are consistently used across the application. This can lead to more robust error handling and easier debugging.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensuring that any code using these enums is updated accordingly.
- **Code Refactoring:** The existing codebase may need refactoring to replace magic strings with enum values.
- **Documentation:** Proper documentation of the new enums should be added to maintain clarity.

Overall, this change enhances code quality and maintainability without introducing significant risks.
