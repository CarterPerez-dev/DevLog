### Change Analysis for `DayCell.tsx`

#### What Was Changed
In the `DayCell` component, the line `disabled={isFuture}` was modified to `disabled={false}`.

#### Why It Was Likely Changed
This change likely indicates an intention to make all cells active and clickable by default. This could be part of a feature where users can interact with every day in the calendar, regardless of whether it is in the future or past.

#### Impact on Behavior
Previously, `isFuture` controlled whether the cell was disabled. Now, setting `disabled={false}` ensures that all cells are enabled and clickable by default. This change could affect user interaction patterns if users expect certain days to be non-interactive based on their context (e.g., future dates).

#### Risks or Concerns
1. **User Expectation Mismatch**: Users might find it confusing if they expect certain days to be disabled, such as future dates.
2. **Feature Impact**: If the `isFuture` logic was used elsewhere in the application, this change could impact other parts of the functionality.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensuring that all cells are enabled by default may not align with accessibility guidelines if some cells should remain non-interactive.

This change likely needs further context or additional comments to explain why all days are now enabled and whether this is intended behavior for the checklist tool.
