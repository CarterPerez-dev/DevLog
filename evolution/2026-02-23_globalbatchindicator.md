### Change Analysis for `GlobalBatchIndicator.tsx`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `GlobalBatchIndicator.tsx`, was added to the repository. This component checks if there are active processing batches and displays a button with an icon and text indicating the progress of these batches.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide users with real-time visibility into ongoing batch uploads. By integrating this indicator, users can easily navigate to view detailed upload progress without leaving their current page.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `GlobalBatchIndicator` enhances the user experience by offering a quick way to monitor and manage batch processing tasks directly from any part of the application. The button's title and click event redirect users to the upload progress page, ensuring they can stay engaged with ongoing operations.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is likely beneficial for monitoring purposes, there are a few potential risks:
- **Navigation Latency:** Navigating to another route might introduce latency if the server response time is slow.
- **Resource Usage:** Frequent re-renders of this component could impact performance if active processing batches are common.

Overall, this addition provides useful functionality with minimal risk.
