### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** 
The file `angela.enums.ts` has been completely removed, consisting of 21 lines.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of a refactoring effort to consolidate enums related to the Angela AI Assistant. The removal suggests that these enums may have been moved or combined with other enum files, possibly to improve code organization and maintainability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of these enums will affect any parts of the codebase that rely on them for state management (e.g., `AngelaState`) and expression definitions (e.g., `Expression`). Developers will need to update their references to use new enum locations or definitions if they still exist.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Breaking Changes:** Any code using these enums directly may break, requiring updates.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that the new location of these enums is well-documented in the project’s documentation.
- **Testing:** Verify that all tests related to these enums are updated accordingly to avoid failures.

This change appears to be a significant refactoring step aimed at improving code structure and could potentially lead to more maintainable code if handled properly.
