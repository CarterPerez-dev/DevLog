### Change Analysis for Commit 3894239b

**What was Changed:**
A new file `run.py` was added to the repository, implementing a FastAPI server for the Angela TTS (Text-to-Speech) application. The file includes setup for the FastAPI application, middleware configuration, and routing.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide a standalone entry point for running the Angela TTS server. By separating this logic into `run.py`, the developers can better manage different deployment scenarios or testing environments without modifying the core application code.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `run.py` introduces a new way to start the FastAPI server, allowing it to be run directly from this file using the provided command. This simplifies the process of starting the server and ensures that all necessary configurations (like CORS settings) are applied correctly.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure that `uvicorn` is properly installed in any environment where this script will be used.
- **Configuration Consistency:** Verify that the values for `APP_TITLE`, `APP_VERSION`, `HOST`, and `PORT` are consistent with other parts of the application, if they exist.
- **Security Considerations:** The use of `allow_origins = ["*"]` in CORS middleware could pose security risks. It is recommended to restrict origins to specific domains or IP addresses.

This change enhances modularity and ease of deployment while introducing some potential security concerns that should be addressed.
