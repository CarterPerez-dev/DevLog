### Change Analysis for Commit 3894239b in `Angela-Wake/server/run.py`

**What was Changed:**
- A new file, `run.py`, was added to the repository.
- The file contains a FastAPI application setup and configuration.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this file likely represents an initial implementation for running the Angela Wake Word server. It sets up the FastAPI framework with necessary middleware (CORS) and includes routing from another module (`routes.py`). This is typical when starting to develop a RESTful API or web service.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The server will now use FastAPI, which is known for its simplicity and performance.
- CORS settings are configured permissive by default, allowing any origin to access the API. This might need adjustment in production environments.
- The application title and version are defined using variables from `config.py`, promoting better maintainability.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- Using `"*"` for `allow_origins` could expose the server to security risks if not properly managed in a production environment.
- The permissive CORS settings might allow unauthorized access, which should be reviewed and adjusted as needed.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block runs Uvicorn with default host and port. This is fine for local development but may need configuration for deployment.

Overall, this change sets up a basic but functional FastAPI server for the Angela Wake Word application.
