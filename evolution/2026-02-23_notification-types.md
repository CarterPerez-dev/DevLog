### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `red-recon/src/api/types/notification.types.ts`, the commit modified the titles and bodies of notification messages for three different types (`PERIOD_REMINDER`, `PMS_ALERT`, and `OVULATION_ALERT`). Specifically, the titles were changed to more dramatic or urgent-sounding phrases, while the body texts were updated with more emphatic language.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The changes likely aim to enhance user engagement by making notifications more impactful and attention-grabbing. The new messages are designed to be more assertive and less ambiguous, which could help users take immediate action or prepare adequately for the events being notified.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change will alter how notifications appear to users. Users might find these updated notifications more compelling and less likely to be ignored. However, there is a risk that overly dramatic language may come across as insensitive or inappropriate in certain contexts.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Sensitivity:** The new wording could potentially alienate some users if they find the tone too aggressive or disrespectful.
- **User Experience:** While more engaging, the changes might also lead to user frustration if notifications are perceived as overly urgent or threatening.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring that these dramatic changes align with the overall application's tone and brand is crucial.

Overall, while the intention seems positive, careful consideration should be given to how users will react.
