### Change Analysis for Commit 5a7c48c4

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file `analyzer.go` in the `internal/analyzer` package, defining interfaces and types for security analyzers. The changes include:
- Defining an `Analyzer` interface with methods to return the analyzer's name and perform analysis.
- Creating a `Result` struct to encapsulate the outcome of an analysis run.
- Introducing constants representing categories for organizing security findings.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to establish a structured approach for integrating various security analyzers into the `docksec` project. By defining clear interfaces and types, the codebase can be more modular and easier to extend with new analyzer implementations.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these abstractions allows for consistent handling of analysis results across different security tools or plugins that might be integrated into the system. This ensures uniformity in how findings are reported and categorized.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is foundational, there's a risk that future implementations may not fully adhere to the defined interfaces without proper documentation and enforcement mechanisms. Additionally, the initial implementation of analyzers will need thorough testing to ensure they produce valid results and handle errors appropriately.
