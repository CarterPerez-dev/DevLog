### Change Analysis for Commit 8c757802

**What was Changed:**
A new file `error_schemas.py` was added to the repository. This file introduces a new class `ErrorDetail`, which extends `BaseSchema`. The class defines two fields, `detail` and `type`, with appropriate descriptions and default values.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this schema likely aims to standardize error responses in the application. By defining a structured format for errors using Pydantic's `Field` and `ConfigDict`, the team can ensure consistency across different parts of the application. This is particularly useful for API responses, making them more predictable and easier to handle.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change impacts how error details are represented in the application. Now, any function or endpoint that returns an error will use this standardized schema. This could lead to improved debugging and better user experience as errors can be easily parsed and understood by both developers and end-users.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While adding a new file is generally low-risk, there are a few considerations:
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that existing code does not break due to the introduction of this new schema.
- **Documentation:** The `ConfigDict` with examples is helpful but should be documented in the project's documentation for future reference.
- **Usage Consistency:** Make sure all error responses use this schema consistently across the application.

Overall, this change enhances the structure and consistency of error handling in the social-media-notes application.
