### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `PROJECTS/intermediate/api-security-scanner/backend/core/enums.py`, the author modified the import statements and class definitions for enums. Specifically, all instances of `Enum` were replaced with `StrEnum`.

- **Lines 2-10:** The import statement changed from `from enum import Enum` to `from enum import StrEnum`.
- **Lines 15-27 & 27-39:** The class definitions for `ScanStatus`, `Severity`, and `TestType` were updated from inheriting from `str, Enum` to directly inheriting from `StrEnum`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely due to Python 3.10's introduction of the `StrEnum` type. The `StrEnum` class provides a more concise and safer way to define string enums by automatically making all members strings, which can help prevent errors when working with enum values.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains largely unchanged since both `str, Enum` and `StrEnum` ensure that the enum members are strings. However, using `StrEnum` simplifies the code and leverages Python's improved type checking capabilities introduced in 3.10.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that any existing code that relies on these enums works correctly with the new definition.
- **Type Checking:** The enhanced type checking provided by `StrEnum` might catch more errors, but it also means developers need to be aware of this change if they are working in an older Python environment.

Overall, this change is a refactoring to take advantage of newer language features without altering the functionality.
