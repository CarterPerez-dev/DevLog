## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code in `daily.interfaces.ts` was modified to convert TypeScript interfaces for `DailyQuestionResponse` and `SubmitDailyAnswerResponse` into Zod schemas. Additionally, type definitions were updated using `z.infer` to maintain the same structure but with validation.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change is part of a larger refactoring effort to migrate domain logic from manual TypeScript interfaces to Zod schemas for better validation and type safety. This transition likely aims to improve code readability, reduce bugs related to incorrect data types, and facilitate easier schema management.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged as the new schemas are inferred into the same interface types. However, this change introduces static validation at compile time, ensuring that only valid data can be passed through these interfaces.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While Zod provides robust validation, there is a risk of introducing subtle bugs if the schema definitions do not perfectly match the expected data format. Careful testing is required to ensure all existing and future use cases are correctly validated. Additionally, developers need to familiarize themselves with Zod's syntax for maintaining consistency across the project.
