### Change Analysis for `client_test.go`

**What was Changed:**
A new test file, `client_test.go`, was added to the `pypi` package. This file contains 12 test cases within a single test function, `TestNormalizeName`. The tests aim to validate the behavior of the `NormalizeName` function, which normalizes package names according to certain rules.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this test suite likely indicates an effort to ensure that the `NormalizeName` function behaves as expected across a variety of input scenarios. This is crucial for maintaining consistent and predictable behavior in package name handling within the PyPI client module.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These tests will help catch any issues with how package names are normalized, ensuring that all package names conform to the desired format. This can prevent potential mismatches or errors when interacting with the PyPI repository.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this test suite is a positive step towards robust testing, there is a risk that new edge cases might be introduced if the normalization logic changes in future updates. It's important to continue expanding and maintaining these tests as the code evolves. Additionally, ensuring that `NormalizeName` handles all possible input types and edge cases (like invalid characters) will further solidify its reliability.

Overall, this change enhances the quality of the PyPI client module by adding comprehensive test coverage for a critical function.
