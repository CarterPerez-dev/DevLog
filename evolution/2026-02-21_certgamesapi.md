## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code added several new classes and models related to a terminal takedown game in `CertGamesAPI.py`. Specifically, the following were introduced:
- `TerminalChallengesResponse`
- `EvaluateTerminalCommandResponse`
- `SubmitTerminalScoreResponse`
- `TerminalLeaderboardResponse`

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely support the addition of a new feature to CertGames, specifically a terminal-based takedown game. The new models are designed to handle responses related to challenges, command evaluation, score submission, and leaderboard entries for this new game.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these classes will enable the backend API to properly process requests and responses associated with the new terminal game feature. This could include handling user commands in a simulated terminal environment, evaluating their correctness, and updating user scores and achievements.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Compatibility:** The addition of new endpoints and models might break existing client implementations if they are not updated to handle these changes.
- **Testing:** Given that 10 tests were added for the CompTIA SecAI+ v1 exam, it’s important to ensure thorough testing of the new game feature to avoid regressions in other areas.
- **Performance Impact:** The new game logic might introduce additional computational overhead, particularly if command evaluation is resource-intensive.

Overall, these changes are likely part of a significant update to CertGames, enhancing its functionality and providing users with a more comprehensive learning experience.
