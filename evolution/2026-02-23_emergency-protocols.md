### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `emergency-protocols.tsx` was added to the repository, containing a list of emergency protocols and their corresponding components. The file includes an array of `Protocol` objects with icons, titles, threat levels, and steps for handling various scenarios.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents a feature addition aimed at providing a structured way to handle specific emotional or situational emergencies within the application. The use of Lucide icons and Tamagui components suggests an effort to make the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these protocols will enable users to quickly access and understand how to respond in various emergency situations, potentially improving their interaction with the app during stressful scenarios.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this feature is likely intended for a specific context (possibly related to emotional support), there could be risks if the content is not appropriate or if it misleads users. Additionally, ensuring that all icons and steps are culturally sensitive and relevant will be crucial. The use of color coding in `threatColors` might need further refinement to ensure clear visual communication.

Overall, this change enhances the application's utility but requires careful consideration of its implementation details.
