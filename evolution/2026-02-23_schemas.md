### Change Analysis for `backend/app/auth/schemas.py`

**What was Changed:**
The file `schemas.py` was added to the repository, introducing several new schema classes for authentication and user management. Specifically, it includes:
- `LoginRequest`: A schema for login requests.
- `TokenResponse`: A response schema for tokens.
- `TokenWithUserResponse`: An extended token response including user data.
- `RefreshTokenRequest`: A request schema for refreshing tokens.
- `PasswordResetRequest` and `PasswordResetConfirm`: Schemas for password reset operations.
- `PasswordChange`: A schema for changing passwords while authenticated.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize input and output data structures for authentication endpoints, enhancing type safety and clarity. The use of Pydantic models ensures that requests and responses are validated against defined schemas, reducing the risk of invalid or unexpected data being processed.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These new schema definitions will affect how login, token management, password reset, and password change operations are handled in the application. They ensure consistent validation rules for user inputs and responses, improving the robustness and maintainability of the authentication system.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While these changes improve data validation, they also introduce a risk if not all existing code paths have been updated to use these new schemas. Ensure that all relevant endpoints are properly updated to utilize these new schema definitions to avoid potential bugs or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the introduction of new classes may require adjustments in other parts of the application where these schemas are referenced.
