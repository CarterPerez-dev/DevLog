### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `schemas.py` was added to the repository, introducing three Pydantic models: `Message`, `ChatRequest`, and `ChatResponse`. Each model is documented with a docstring.

- **Message:** Represents an individual chat message with attributes `role` (str) and `content` (str).
- **ChatRequest:** Defines the request body for a chat endpoint, requiring a list of `Message` objects and an optional boolean `stream`.
- **ChatResponse:** Describes a non-streaming response from the chat endpoint, including a single `Message`, model name (`model`), and a boolean indicating if it's the final message (`done`).

**Why It Was Likely Changed:**
This change was likely made to standardize data validation and serialization for the chat application. The introduction of these schemas ensures that incoming requests and outgoing responses are structured correctly, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these models will enforce strict type checking and validation rules in the backend. This is crucial for ensuring consistent behavior across different parts of the application and simplifies handling data in both client and server-side logic.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change introduces robust schemas, there's a risk that existing code might not be compatible with these new models unless updated to use them. Additionally, if the schema definitions are changed later, it could break existing integrations. Careful testing is recommended before deploying any changes that depend on these schemas.
