### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file named `schemas.py` was added to the repository, containing a single class definition `AppInfoResponse`. This class inherits from `BaseModel` in Pydantic and includes three attributes: `name`, `version`, and `docs_url`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this schema is likely part of completing MVP v1.0.0 as indicated by the commit message. The `AppInfoResponse` class defines a structured response for the root endpoint, providing essential information such as API name, version, and documentation URL.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change introduces a new data model that will be used to structure responses from the root endpoint of the API. This ensures consistency in how API information is returned and can facilitate easier integration with client applications or testing tools.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Versioning:** The copyright year (2026) might be premature, indicating potential issues if not updated.
- **Deprecation:** If this schema becomes outdated, it could lead to inconsistencies in API responses. Regular updates should be planned.
- **Testing:** Ensure that tests cover the new endpoint and response structure.

This change is a feature addition, enhancing the API's ability to provide clear and structured information about itself.
