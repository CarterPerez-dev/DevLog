### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `schemas.py` was added to the `backend/app/tts/` directory. This file introduces two Pydantic models: `SynthesizeRequest` and `VoiceInfo`. The former represents a request body for text-to-speech synthesis, while the latter contains voice information returned by an endpoint.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize data validation and serialization in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) module. By using Pydantic models, the code can ensure that incoming requests are structured correctly and that responses contain only necessary fields, enhancing both robustness and maintainability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these schemas will enforce type hints and validation rules for request and response objects in the TTS service. This ensures that any function handling text-to-synthesis or voice information adheres to a clear structure, reducing potential bugs related to incorrect data formats.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While Pydantic models are generally beneficial, there is a risk of over-engineering if too many schemas are created prematurely. Ensuring these schemas cover all necessary cases and do not overly complicate the codebase will be important. Additionally, any existing code that interacts with these new schemas needs to be updated accordingly.

Overall, this change aligns well with best practices in modern Python development, particularly for APIs where data validation is crucial.
