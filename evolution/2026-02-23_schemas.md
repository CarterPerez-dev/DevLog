### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file named `schemas.py` was added to the repository. This file introduces a single class, `TranscriptionResponse`, which inherits from `BaseModel` in the Pydantic library. The class defines three attributes: `text`, `language`, and `duration`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of implementing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for version 1.0.0, as indicated by the commit message. Adding a schema definition helps in structuring the expected response format from the speech-to-text service, ensuring consistency and ease of validation.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `TranscriptionResponse` will affect how responses are handled within the application. Any part of the code that processes transcription results now has a clear structure to expect, which can improve maintainability and reduce bugs related to incorrect data handling.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is beneficial for structuring response data, there's a risk if other parts of the application are not yet aware of this schema. Ensuring that all relevant code paths correctly use `TranscriptionResponse` will be crucial to avoid runtime errors and ensure consistency across the application.

Overall, this addition aligns with best practices in API design by providing clear structure definitions for data exchange.
