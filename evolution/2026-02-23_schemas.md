### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file, `schemas.py`, which contains two Pydantic models: `WakeWordModelsResponse` and `WakeWordDetection`. The file defines these schemas to structure responses from the API related to wake word detection.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of implementing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a voice assistant or smart home application. The introduction of these models suggests that the system will now be able to respond with structured data about available wake word models and events of detected wake words, including details like detection status, model used, and confidence score.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These schemas will likely impact the API responses, ensuring consistency in how data is returned. For example, when listing available wake word models or reporting a detection event, the JSON responses will now have a standardized structure that can be easily parsed by clients.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Versioning:** Since this is part of MVP v1.0.0, changes to these schemas might break compatibility with existing clients if not handled carefully.
- **Extensibility:** While the current models are basic, they may need to be extended in future updates (e.g., adding more fields for detailed logs or additional metadata).
- **Documentation:** Ensuring that these schemas are well-documented and understood by all team members is crucial to maintain consistency across the project.

Overall, this change enhances the structure of API responses, making them more predictable and easier to handle.
