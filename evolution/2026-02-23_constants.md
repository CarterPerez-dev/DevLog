### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit `8c757802` added a new file `constants.py` in the `backend/app/core/` directory. This file introduces several constant definitions for various lengths and API versioning.

- **Line 3:** Added a docstring with copyright information.
- **Lines 4-19:** Defined constants such as `EMAIL_MAX_LENGTH`, `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`, `PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH`, etc., along with `TOKEN_HASH_LENGTH`, `DEVICE_ID_MAX_LENGTH`, `DEVICE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH`, and `IP_ADDRESS_MAX_LENGTH`.
- **Line 20:** Defined the API version string.
- **Line 21:** Constructed an API prefix using the defined API version.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration constants, making them easier to manage and update. By defining these values in a single file, the codebase can be more maintainable and consistent.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The introduction of these constants will affect how email addresses, passwords, tokens, device identifiers, and other data are handled throughout the application.
- The `API_VERSION` constant ensures that all API endpoints use a consistent versioning scheme.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Hardcoding:** While centralizing constants is beneficial, overusing hardcoded values can make the code less flexible. Ensure these constants are used appropriately and not overly restrictive.
- **Security Considerations:** Constants like `PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH` should be carefully chosen to balance security and usability. For example, a minimum password length of 8 characters might be too short for some use cases.

Overall, this change improves code organization but requires careful consideration during implementation to avoid potential issues.
