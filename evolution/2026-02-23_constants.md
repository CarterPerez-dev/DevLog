### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `config/constants.py`, was added to the repository. This file introduces a series of constants used throughout the application, including magic values like code lengths, currency settings, and API version strings.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration parameters for easier management and consistency across the application. By defining these constants in one place, it simplifies updates and reduces the risk of hard-coded values leading to bugs or inconsistencies.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These constants will affect various parts of the application, such as code generation rules, payout amounts, database connection settings, and webhook timeouts. For example, `DEFAULT_PAYOUT_CURRENCY` and `MIN_MAX_REWARDS_PER_USER` will influence how payouts are processed and rewards are managed.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Maintenance:** Ensuring all relevant parts of the application use these constants consistently.
- **Deprecation:** If a constant is updated but not used, it could lead to confusion or unused code.
- **Testing:** New constants may require additional tests to ensure they behave as expected in different scenarios.

Overall, this change enhances maintainability and clarity at the cost of initial setup effort.
