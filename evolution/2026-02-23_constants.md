### Change Analysis for `internal/config/constants.go`

**What was Changed:**
The file `internal/config/constants.go` was added, introducing 27 constants related to scanner configuration. These include values for concurrency (`MaxWorkers`, `DefaultWorkerCount`), rate limiting (`RateLimitPerSecond`, `RateLimitBurst`), timeouts (`DefaultTimeout`, `InspectTimeout`, `ConnectionTimeout`), and thresholds for findings and entropy.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration settings, making them easier to manage and modify. By defining these constants in a single file, the codebase becomes more modular and maintainable. The values chosen are typical for security scanning tools, balancing concurrency with rate limiting to prevent overloading systems.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These changes will affect how the scanner operates. For example, `MaxWorkers` and `RateLimitPerSecond` control the number of concurrent tasks and the rate at which they can be processed, respectively. The timeouts ensure that operations do not hang indefinitely. The findings thresholds (`MaxTotalFindings`, `SARIFMaxResults`) limit the output size, which is useful for performance optimization.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Default Values:** Default values like `DefaultWorkerCount` and `RateLimitPerSecond` might be too high or low depending on the environment. Care must be taken to ensure these defaults are appropriate.
- **Error Handling:** While not directly related, ensuring proper error handling when these constants are used in critical paths is essential. For instance, if a timeout occurs, how will it be handled?
- **Scalability:** The chosen values should be scalable and configurable based on the environment (e.g., cloud vs. local). Hardcoded values might need to be adjusted for different use cases.

Overall, this change enhances code organization and maintainability while introducing potential risks that need careful consideration during implementation.
