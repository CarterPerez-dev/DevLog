Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The `errors.ts` file in the `react-scss/src/core/api/` directory was modified to update comments and import statements. The copyright notice was updated from 2025 to 2026, and a new comment block was added at the top of the file.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in the project's metadata or documentation practices. Updating the year in the comments is common when making significant changes or transitioning between development phases. The addition of a comment block might be for better code organization or to serve as a reference point within the file.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the application remains unchanged since this change only affects metadata and does not alter any functional logic. Users will not notice any difference in error handling or API interactions.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks associated with this change. However, it's important to ensure that all other parts of the codebase are updated consistently if such changes are part of a larger refactoring effort. Additionally, verifying that the copyright updates align with legal requirements and company policies is crucial.

Overall, this change appears to be a minor update reflecting progress in the project lifecycle without impacting functionality.
