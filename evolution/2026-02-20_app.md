### Change Analysis for Commit 47432c8c

**What Changed:**
The code removed the import of `RateLimitMiddleware` from line 16 and commented out its usage, which is indicated by the removal of the import statement.

**Why It Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely addresses an issue or refactoring related to rate limiting middleware. The removal suggests that the developer might have decided to disable or refactor the middleware for a specific reason, possibly due to changes in requirements, testing issues, or simplifying the application's architecture.

**Impact on Behavior:**
Without `RateLimitMiddleware`, the rate limiting functionality provided by `fastapi_420` will not be active. This could affect the performance and security of the API by removing rate limits, potentially allowing uncontrolled access to endpoints.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** Removing rate limiting could expose the application to potential abuse or denial-of-service attacks.
- **Testing Issues:** If testing relied on rate limiting, this change might break those tests unless they are updated accordingly.
- **Future Maintenance:** The removal of middleware without a clear reason in the commit message may complicate future maintenance and understanding of the codebase.

This change should be reviewed carefully to ensure it aligns with the project's security requirements.
