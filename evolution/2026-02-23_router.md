### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `router.py`, was added to the backend directory of the repository `angelamos-3d`. This file defines two API endpoints using FastAPI:
1. A POST endpoint at `/tts/synthesize` that takes a `SynthesizeRequest` object and returns an audio response.
2. A GET endpoint at `/tts/voices` that lists available Edge TTS voices.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely marks the completion of MVP v1.0.0 for text-to-speech functionality, providing both synthesis and voice listing capabilities. The addition of these endpoints suggests a focus on enabling users to generate speech from text and explore available voices.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- Users can now send POST requests to `/tts/synthesize` with `SynthesizeRequest` data to receive audio responses.
- GET requests to `/tts/voices` will return a list of available Edge TTS voices, aiding in voice selection for synthesis.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- The endpoints assume the availability and proper configuration of the `service.synthesize` and `service.list_voices` methods. Ensure these services are robust and handle potential errors gracefully.
- Security considerations should be addressed, especially if sensitive data is involved in text-to-speech requests.

This change significantly enhances the application's functionality by adding core TTS capabilities, aligning with the MVP milestone.
