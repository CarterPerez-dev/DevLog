### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `backend/api/domains/account/models/User.py`, a new enum value `COMPTIA_SECAI_PLUS` was added to the `CertificationType` enum class, replacing the old line 116 with an additional line.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update to support a new certification type for the CompTIA SecAI+ v1 exam/certification. The addition of this value is part of the broader changes in commit `fe44f45e`, which includes adding tests and updating dependencies.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `COMPTIA_SECAI_PLUS` to the enum will allow the application to recognize and handle this new certification type. This could impact user accounts, certifications tracking, and possibly related functionalities in the backend API.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Users with existing data might not have this new certification type recognized.
- **Code Updates:** Other parts of the codebase that reference `CertificationType` may need to be updated to include this new value.
- **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing is conducted to validate that all related functionalities work as expected with the new certification type.

This change appears to be a feature addition rather than a bug fix, and it introduces no immediate risks but requires careful handling during deployment.
