### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `phishing_ctrl.py` file, the line 65 to 67 block of code that previously called `ProgressionService.update_xp_and_coins(user, xp_to_award, coins_to_award)` with explicit parameters has been simplified by removing the newline and indentations. The function call now directly follows the declaration.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve readability or adhere to a preferred coding style within the project. Simplifying the code in this manner can make the line less cluttered, potentially making the intent clearer for other developers reading the code.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of updating user experience points (XP) and coins remains unchanged. The function `ProgressionService.update_xp_and_coins` is still called with the same parameters, ensuring that the logic for awarding XP and coins based on the phishing score continues to operate as intended.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change does not introduce any functional risks, it’s important to ensure consistency in coding styles across the project. The removal of unnecessary newlines might be part of a larger refactoring effort, but it should be done consistently throughout the codebase to maintain readability and avoid confusion for other contributors.

Overall, this is a minor refactor that likely improves code aesthetics without altering functionality.
