### Change Analysis

**What was Changed**: 
The `qa/conftest.py` file in the `backend/api/domains/games/qa` directory had several minor changes, primarily involving the removal of unnecessary whitespace and reformatting of string literals within a function that generates sample phishing examples. Specifically:
- Lines 199, 287, and 337 removed redundant spaces before the equals sign (`=`) in dictionary key-value pairs.
- The `message`, `description`, and `download_url` keys were reindented to align with the surrounding code.

**Why it was Likely Changed**: 
This change likely aimed at improving code readability and adhering to Python's PEP 8 style guide, which recommends consistent spacing around operators. This refactoring does not alter the functional behavior of the code but enhances its maintainability.

**Impact on Behavior**: 
There is no impact on the function’s behavior or output. The sample phishing examples generated by this function will remain unchanged in terms of their structure and content.

**Risks or Concerns**: 
- While these changes are minor, they could potentially introduce subtle issues if the original spacing had a specific purpose (which seems unlikely given PEP 8 compliance).
- Ensuring that such changes do not inadvertently break any existing tests is important. However, since this change only involves formatting, it should be safe.

Overall, this change is a clean-up effort with no functional impact and minimal risk.
