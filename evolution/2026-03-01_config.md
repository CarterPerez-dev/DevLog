+Pydantic-settings configuration with RATELIMIT_ env prefix
+
+All rate limiter settings are validated here and loaded from
+environment variables. The top-level RateLimiterSettings nests
+three sub-configs (storage, fingerprint, defense) and includes
+model validators that resolve shorthand like algorithm names
+and rule strings into their typed equivalents.
+
+Key exports:
+  StorageSettings - Redis URL, max keys, backend selection
+  FingerprintSettings - extractor toggles and fingerprint level
+  RateLimiterSettings - main config that composes all sub-configs
+  get_settings() - cached singleton factory
+
+Connects to:
+  types.py - imports Algorithm, DefenseMode, FingerprintLevel, RateLimitRule

### Change Analysis for Commit `f9b5a614`

**What Was Changed:**
The file `config.py` in the `fastapi_420` directory has been significantly modified to include detailed Pydantic-settings configuration with an environment variable prefix (`RATELIMIT_`). The changes introduce a comprehensive structure for rate limiter settings, including sub-configurations for storage, fingerprinting, and defense mechanisms. Additionally, model validators are added to resolve shorthand notations into their typed equivalents.

**Why It Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve the modularity and flexibility of the rate limiter configuration by separating concerns into distinct classes (`StorageSettings`, `FingerprintSettings`, `RateLimiterSettings`). This approach enhances readability, maintainability, and ease of configuration management. The introduction of model validators ensures that settings are validated against a defined schema, reducing the risk of misconfiguration.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The new structure allows for more granular control over rate limiter configurations without affecting other parts of the application. Developers can now easily adjust storage backend selection, fingerprinting rules, and defense modes independently. The `get_settings()` factory function ensures that settings are cached to optimize performance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the changes improve configuration management, there is a risk if environment variables are not correctly set. Misconfiguration could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the introduction of new classes may require updates in other parts of the codebase where these settings are used. Careful testing and documentation are essential to mitigate these risks.
