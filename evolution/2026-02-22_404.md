### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code in `frontend/src/routes/[...404].tsx` was modified to replace a simple 404 error component with a navigation component that redirects the user back to the home page.

- **Removed:** The `MinimalNotFound` component definition and its implementation.
- **Added:** An import for `Navigate` from `@solidjs/router`.
- **Modified:** Replaced the old component export with a new function named `CatchAll` that uses `Navigate` to redirect to the root path (`/`).

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve user experience by providing a more dynamic and useful response when a 404 error occurs. Instead of displaying a static "Page Not Found" message, users are redirected to the home page where they can explore other content or find what they were looking for.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Positive:** Users will be directed back to the main navigation, which may help them find their intended destination more easily.
- **Negative:** The static 404 message is no longer displayed, which might reduce immediate feedback about why a page was not found.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **User Experience:** While redirection can be helpful, users who are looking for specific content may feel lost if they do not see the error message.
- **SEO:** Search engines and crawlers might not get the same 404 status as before, which could affect how pages are indexed.

Overall, this change likely represents a refactor to improve user navigation but should be tested thoroughly to ensure it meets all requirements.
