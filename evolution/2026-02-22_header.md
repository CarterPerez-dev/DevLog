The new "Checklist" feature is now easily accessible from the header, allowing users to quickly navigate to this section without having to go through other menus. This change enhances user experience by providing a more streamlined way to access important features.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no apparent risks introduced by this change. However, it's important to ensure that the new "Checklist" page is properly implemented and styled to maintain consistency with the rest of the application. Additionally, testing should be conducted to confirm that all links in the header function as expected.

Overall, this change appears to be a feature addition aimed at improving user navigation within the application.
