### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `backend/api/domains/games/nsdocs/__init__.py`, a new section was added to import and define documentation for terminal game-related functions. Specifically, four new functions were introduced:
- `GET_TERMINAL_CHALLENGES_DOC`
- `EVALUATE_TERMINAL_COMMAND_DOC`
- `SUBMIT_TERMINAL_SCORE_DOC`
- `GET_TERMINAL_LEADERBOARD_DOC`

Additionally, these new function names were added to the `__all__` list.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects the addition of a terminal-based takedown game feature as mentioned in the commit message. The introduction of detailed documentation for these functions suggests that they are part of a larger effort to enhance and document the new game functionality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is primarily on the API documentation, making it clearer which endpoints exist for the new terminal game functionalities. This change does not affect existing behavior but improves clarity and maintainability.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no apparent risks introduced by this change. However, ensuring that these new functions are correctly implemented and tested will be crucial to avoid any future issues. The addition of 10 tests for the CompTIA SecAI+ v1 exam/certification in the same commit suggests that testing is being prioritized, which is a positive sign.

Overall, this change is part of an ongoing effort to enhance and document new features in CertGames.
