 ]
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change was likely made to implement a new terminal-based game feature, as indicated by the commit message mentioning the addition of a "terminal takedown game". The imports and `__all__` list updates ensure that these new functions are available for use in other parts of the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these functions will enable users to interact with the terminal-based game, including challenges, command evaluation, scoring, and leaderboard functionality. This enhances the gamification aspect of the application by providing a new gameplay mode.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Deprecation Risk:** The commit message mentions updating dependencies but does not specify which ones. Ensure that these updates do not introduce compatibility issues with existing parts of the application.
- **Testing:** With the addition of 10 tests for the CompTIA SecAI+ v1 exam, it is crucial to ensure that all new functions are thoroughly tested and integrated correctly.
- **Documentation:** New features should be documented properly to guide developers and users on how to use these new functionalities.
