### Change Analysis for Commit `fe44f45e`

**What was Changed:**
In the file `backend/api/domains/games/routes/__init__.py`, a single line was added:
```python
from . import terminal
```
and then immediately commented out with an error message:
```python
# error there but not here wtf
```
Additionally, this same comment appears twice in quick succession.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of `terminal` to the imports suggests that a new game or feature related to a terminal-based takedown was added. The repeated error comments indicate potential confusion or issues during development, possibly related to the import statement or another part of the codebase that is not clearly visible from this diff.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `terminal` will allow access to any functions or classes defined in the `terminal` module within the `__init__.py` file. However, since it is immediately commented out, no functional changes are expected at present.

**Risks and Concerns:**
1. **Potential Bug:** The repeated error comments suggest there might be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.
2. **Code Clarity:** Having the import statement commented out without a clear reason could confuse future maintainers.
3. **Future Development:** If this import is intended for use, it should not be immediately commented out.

Overall, while the change introduces a new module into the game routes, the immediate commenting out of the import suggests there may be ongoing issues that need to be resolved before the feature can be fully utilized.
