### Change Analysis for Commit 3894239b

**What was Changed:**
The file `Angela-TTS/server/__init__.py` was added as a new file with a single-line docstring defining the purpose of the Angela TTS Server.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents an initial step in organizing and documenting the server component of the Angela Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. The addition of this `__init__.py` file is common practice in Python projects to mark a directory as a package, which can help with module imports and organizational structure.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The current change does not alter any existing functionality or behavior since it only adds a docstring. However, it sets the stage for future development by ensuring that the server directory is recognized as a package within the project.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Documentation:** While adding documentation is beneficial, there should be plans to expand this with more detailed information about the server's architecture and functionality.
- **Future Development:** The addition of an `__init__.py` file without any other content might lead to confusion if developers are not aware that it marks a package. It’s important to ensure that all necessary initialization code is included in such files as needed.

Overall, this change is a good practice for project organization and documentation but should be followed up with more substantive development.
