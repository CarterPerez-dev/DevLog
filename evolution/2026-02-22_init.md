### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/api/domains/games/controllers/terminal` directory. This file imports and exports functions related to a terminal-based game challenge.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this file likely aligns with the introduction of a new feature, specifically a "takedown game" as mentioned in the commit message. The `__init__.py` file serves as an entry point for these game-related functions, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change introduces functionality for handling terminal-based challenges within the game system. Users will now be able to interact with a new type of game challenge that requires command-line input and evaluation. The addition of tests and back buttons also enhances user experience, providing more navigational options.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Code Organization:** Ensuring that all game-related functions are logically grouped in this file.
- **Dependency Management:** The update to dependencies might introduce compatibility issues if not thoroughly tested.
- **Testing Coverage:** While 10 tests were added, it's important to verify their effectiveness and ensure they cover edge cases.

This change is a feature addition rather than a bug fix or refactor.
