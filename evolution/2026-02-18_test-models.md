### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit modifies several test cases in `test_models.py` to use `pytest.approx()` for comparing floating-point numbers, and updates some variable assignments to align with Python's conventional whitespace. Specifically:
- Added `pytest.approx()` for comparing timestamps and durations.
- Updated line endings and spacing to follow PEP 8 conventions.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve the precision of floating-point comparisons in test cases, ensuring that small numerical differences do not cause tests to fail. The whitespace adjustments are probably part of a broader code formatting effort to adhere to PEP 8 standards and maintain consistency across the project.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The use of `pytest.approx()` ensures more reliable testing for floating-point values by allowing a tolerance in comparisons, which is crucial for numerical computations like timestamps and durations. This change does not affect the logic or functionality of the models but enhances test robustness.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks introduced by this change. However, it's important to ensure that all floating-point values being compared with `pytest.approx()` have appropriate tolerances defined to avoid overly permissive tests. Additionally, maintaining consistent code formatting can help reduce bugs and improve readability but should be done systematically across the entire project.
