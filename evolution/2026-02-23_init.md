Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

### Change Analysis for Commit `ca3ce30d`

**What Changed:**
The changes in the `codeworm/analysis/__init__.py` file primarily involve adding new imports and updating the `__all__` list to include them. Specifically, the additions are:
- `DocumentationTarget`
- `TargetRouter`
- `select_doc_type`

**Why It Was Likely Changed:**
These additions likely support a new feature or functionality related to documentation analysis within the CodeWorm project. The introduction of weighted random selection for documentation types (`select_doc_type`) suggests an effort to diversify and enrich the generated content, possibly enhancing the tool's utility in generating varied and comprehensive documentation.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is primarily internal, affecting how the `analysis` module is structured and imported. Users or developers interacting with this module will now have access to new functionality related to documentation targets and selection processes. This could lead to more dynamic and diverse outputs when analyzing codebases for documentation purposes.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Complexity**: Adding new classes and functions may increase the complexity of the `analysis` module, potentially making it harder to maintain.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring that these new additions are well-documented in the project’s documentation is crucial to avoid confusion.
- **Integration**: The new functionality might need integration testing to ensure compatibility with existing features.

Overall, this change appears to be a feature enhancement aimed at improving the tool's ability to generate diverse and relevant documentation.
