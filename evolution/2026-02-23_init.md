### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/chat/` directory. This file imports and exports the `router` object from a separate module.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of completing MVP v1.0.0 as indicated by the commit message. The purpose of an `__init__.py` file in Python is to mark a directory as a package, allowing for modular imports and initialization code. By adding this file, the developer aims to organize the chat module properly.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `__init__.py` allows other parts of the application to import the `router` object from the `chat` module using `from app.chat import router`. This improves modularity and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Namespace Conflicts:** If multiple modules in different packages have similarly named objects, there could be conflicts when importing.
- **Over-reliance on Importing:** Overuse of `__init__.py` might lead to overly complex import structures if not managed properly.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that the purpose and usage of the `router` object are well-documented for future maintainers.

This change is a feature addition aimed at improving code organization, but it's important to manage imports carefully to avoid potential issues.
