### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `__init__.py`, was added to the `stripe_referral/repositories` directory. This file imports and exports several repository classes including `BaseRepository`, `ReferralCodeRepository`, `ReferralTrackingRepository`, `PayoutRepository`, and `ReferralProgramRepository`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize the import of repositories, making them more accessible from a single point. This is a common practice in Python projects to simplify module usage and maintainability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly alter the functionality but enhances the structure by providing a clear entry point for importing all repository classes. It makes the codebase easier to navigate and use, especially when multiple modules need access to these repositories.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no inherent risks in adding an `__init__.py` file as it is a standard practice in Python packages. However, ensure that this file does not inadvertently import unnecessary dependencies, which could impact the project's performance or introduce security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is exposed.
