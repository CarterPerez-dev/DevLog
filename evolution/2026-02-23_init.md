## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `src/stripe_referral/schemas` directory, containing schema definitions and their associated results for various operations in the Stripe referral system.

**Why it was Likely Changed:** This change likely aims to centralize schema definitions, making them more accessible and maintainable. By organizing schemas into a single file, the codebase becomes easier to navigate and understand.

**Impact on Behavior:** The addition of this `__init__.py` file does not directly impact the behavior of the application but improves the structure and organization of the project. It allows for cleaner imports and better separation of concerns within the schema definitions.

**Risks or Concerns:** While this change is generally positive, it introduces a new entry point in the module hierarchy. Ensure that all dependent modules correctly handle these new imports to avoid potential import errors. Additionally, maintaining consistency in naming conventions and documentation across schemas will be crucial for long-term project sustainability.
