### Change Analysis for Commit 8c757802

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/admin/__init__.py` directory with a brief docstring.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this file is likely part of setting up a new administrative domain within the application. The docstring indicates that this file belongs to an admin module and credits AngelaMos for the copyright, suggesting it might be a placeholder or initial setup for future development in the admin area.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change does not directly impact the application's behavior since it is primarily a documentation file. However, its presence could influence how other developers understand the structure of the project, as it clearly marks this directory as an administrative domain.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Documentation Clarity:** While the docstring provides some context, more detailed documentation might be needed to fully explain the purpose and functionality within this admin module.
- **Future Development:** The file is currently empty. If this is intended to be a starting point for future development, it should include initial setup or import statements to avoid confusion.

Overall, while this change is minimal, it contributes to better project organization and clarity.
