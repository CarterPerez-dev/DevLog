### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/stt` directory. This file imports and exports the `router` object, which is used for routing in the speech-to-text (STT) module.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to modularize the STT component of the application by defining a clear entry point for its router. The `__init__.py` file acts as an initialization script that allows Python to treat the directory as a package, making it easier to manage and import components.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly change the behavior of the STT module but improves its structure and maintainability. It ensures that any changes or additions to the router can be managed within a single file, simplifying future development and maintenance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no immediate risks associated with adding this `__init__.py` file. However, it is essential to ensure that the `router` object correctly initializes and functions as expected when imported from this package. Additionally, any dependencies or configurations required by the router should be properly managed within the module.

Overall, this change enhances the codebase's organization without introducing significant risks.
