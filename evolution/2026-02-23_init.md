Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis for Commit `ca3ce30d`

**What was Changed:**
In the file `codeworm/core/__init__.py`, 5 new import statements and 3 new entries were added to the `__all__` list:
- Imports for `EventPublisher`, `get_publisher`, and `init_publisher`.
- Added these classes/functions to the `__all__` list.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely supports the addition of event publishing functionality, which is part of the new FastAPI backend with WebSocket live events. The `EventPublisher` class and related functions are now exposed for use throughout the codebase, enabling better integration and management of events across different components.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Behavioral Impact:** The introduction of `EventPublisher` allows for more dynamic and real-time communication within the system via WebSocket connections.
- **API Changes:** Users of this module can now directly utilize `EventPublisher`, `get_publisher`, and `init_publisher` without needing to import them separately.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Namespace Pollution:** Adding new entries to `__all__` might lead to namespace pollution if not managed carefully.
- **Deprecation Risk:** If these functions are not used immediately, there is a risk of them being deprecated later on, leading to confusion in the codebase.

Overall, this change enhances the system's event handling capabilities and aligns with the broader updates like the FastAPI backend and React dashboard.
