### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `__init__.py`, was added to the `backend/app/core` directory. This file imports and exports the `AppInfoResponse` class from the `schemes` module.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of completing MVP v1.0.0 as indicated in the commit message. The `__init__.py` file serves as a namespace for the core package, making its contents accessible to other modules without needing to import each class individually.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact the application's behavior but enhances modularity and maintainability by providing a central point for importing classes. This can make code more readable and easier to manage as the project grows.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Namespace Pollution:** While unlikely, if `__all__` is not carefully managed, it could lead to unintended imports.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Ensuring that only necessary classes are included in `__all__` can be a maintenance burden, especially as the project evolves.

Overall, this change aligns with best practices for organizing Python packages and preparing for future development.
