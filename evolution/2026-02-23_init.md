### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `__init__.py`, was added to the `stripe_referral/models` directory. This file contains model exports and imports several classes from submodules: `ReferralProgram`, `ReferralCode`, `ReferralTracking`, and `Payout`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize the export of models, making them more accessible in other parts of the codebase. By using an `__init__.py` file, Python treats this directory as a package, allowing for cleaner imports elsewhere.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is minimal but significant for maintainability and readability. Developers can now import all relevant models from a single point, reducing redundancy in import statements across the codebase.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Namespace Pollution:** Ensure that no naming conflicts arise with other modules.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Regular updates to `__all__` may be required as new models are added or existing ones are modified.
- **Dependency Management:** Verify that all imported classes are correctly defined and available in the package.

Overall, this change enhances code organization without introducing significant risks.
