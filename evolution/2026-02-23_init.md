### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** A new file `config/__init__.py` has been added to the `stripe_referral` repository. This file imports and exports various constants, enums, and settings from sub-modules.

**Why it was Likely Changed:** The addition of this configuration module likely aims to centralize and organize constant values, enums, and settings related to the referral system. By doing so, it improves code readability, maintainability, and ease of configuration management.

**Impact on Behavior:** This change does not directly impact the behavior of the application since no functional changes were made. However, it sets up a structured way for other parts of the application to access these constants and enums, which can be beneficial when implementing features or debugging.

**Risks or Concerns:** While this is primarily a refactor with minimal risk, there's a slight risk that future developers might overlook importing necessary modules if the `__all__` list isn't updated. Additionally, ensuring consistency in naming and usage across the application will be important to avoid potential bugs.
