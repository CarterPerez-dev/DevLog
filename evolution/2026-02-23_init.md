### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/wake` directory. This file imports and exports the `router` object, which is used for defining routes in a web application.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to modularize the code by separating route definitions from other parts of the application. By using an `__init__.py` file, the router can be easily imported and managed as part of the package structure, making the code more organized and maintainable.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact the behavior of the application but improves its structure. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application, such as `backend/app/wake/__main__.py`, where the router can be easily imported using `from wake import router`.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Import Issues:** If not managed properly, circular imports could arise if this file is included in a package that also imports from itself.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** While modularizing code is beneficial, it requires careful management to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity.

Overall, this change enhances the maintainability of the codebase without altering its functionality.
