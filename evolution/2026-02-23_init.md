### Change Analysis for Commit 4d33b24a

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/workers/batch_helpers` directory. This file imports and exports three functions:
- `publish_batch_progress`
- `publish_file_progress`
- `process_upload_with_retry`

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces helper functions for batch processing tasks in a Dramatiq worker context. The new file serves as an entry point, making these functions easily accessible to other parts of the codebase.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this `__init__.py` file encapsulates related functionality under a single namespace (`batch_helpers`). This improves code organization and makes it easier for developers to discover and use these helper functions. The imported functions are likely used in batch processing workflows, such as tracking progress or handling retries.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Namespace Pollution:** While grouping related functions is beneficial, the `__all__` list should be carefully managed to avoid importing unnecessary functions.
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure that these functions do not introduce unintended dependencies on other parts of the codebase. Proper testing and documentation are crucial.

Overall, this change enhances modularity and maintainability without introducing significant risks.
