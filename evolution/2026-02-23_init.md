### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `__init__.py`, has been added to the `stripe_referral/database` directory. This file imports and exports various database-related classes and functions from submodules.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of a refactoring or modularization effort to organize database-related code in a more structured manner. By centralizing these imports in an `__init__.py` file, the project can benefit from improved modularity and easier access to database components across different parts of the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly alter the behavior of the application but enhances code organization. Developers now have a single point of reference for importing database-related classes and functions, which can improve readability and maintainability.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is generally positive, it's important to ensure that all necessary imports are correctly defined in `__init__.py` to avoid import errors. Additionally, maintaining consistency across different submodules will be crucial to prevent any unintended side effects on the application’s behavior.
