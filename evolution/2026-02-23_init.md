Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz

### Change Analysis for Commit `ca3ce30d`

**What was Changed:**
The commit added a new file, `__init__.py`, in the `dashboard/backend` directory. This file contains a simple docstring and is likely used to initialize the backend module.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
Adding an `__init__.py` file marks this directory as a Python package, enabling modular imports and initialization of backend components. This change supports the overall structure of the new FastAPI backend and React dashboard, ensuring that all necessary modules are properly initialized when the application starts.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change does not directly impact the behavior of the application but sets up the infrastructure for better organization and modularity. It allows for cleaner imports and initialization of backend components, which is crucial for maintaining a well-structured codebase as the project grows.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this file itself introduces no significant risks, it's important to ensure that the `__init__.py` file does not contain any executable code. Any such code should be moved to appropriate modules to avoid unintended side effects during initialization. Additionally, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly managed and documented is crucial for future maintainability.

This change aligns with the broader goals of adding a robust backend and dashboard, enhancing the project's scalability and usability.
