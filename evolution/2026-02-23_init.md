```python
Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `app/schemas/` directory in the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend` module. This file contains a simple docstring and is likely used to define package-level imports or provide metadata for the Python interpreter.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
Adding an `__init__.py` file makes the `app/schemas/` directory a Python package, allowing for better organization and easier management of schema definitions across multiple files. This change enables importing schemas from subdirectories within `schemas`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change does not directly impact the application's behavior or API endpoints. However, it improves code structure and maintainability by making the `schemas` directory a proper Python package.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure that any schema files intended to be imported from outside this module are correctly placed in subdirectories.
- **Documentation:** The docstring should clearly describe the purpose of the package, especially if it contains complex schemas.
- **Testing:** Verify that tests for schemas continue to pass without issues.

Overall, this change is a refactor aimed at improving code organization and maintainability without affecting functionality.
