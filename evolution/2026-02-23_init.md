### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `__init__.py`, was added to the `src/stripe_referral/adapters` directory. This file exports various payout adapter classes: `WiseAdapter`, `PayoutAdapter`, `ManualBankAdapter`, and `StripeConnectAdapter`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely part of organizing and modularizing the codebase for better maintainability and ease of extension. By centralizing these imports in an `__init__.py` file, other parts of the application can easily import all payout adapters using a single line (`from src.stripe_referral.adapters import *`).

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this `__init__.py` file does not change the behavior of the existing code. However, it improves the structure and readability by making the adapter classes more accessible.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Namespace Pollution:** Using `*` imports in other modules could lead to namespace pollution if multiple files use wildcard imports.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** While this change is beneficial for organization, developers must ensure that new adapters are properly added to the `__all__` list to maintain correct import functionality.

Overall, this change enhances code organization without introducing significant risks.
