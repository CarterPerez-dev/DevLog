### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/tts` directory. This file imports and exports the `router` object, which is used to define routes for text-to-speech functionality.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents an initial setup or organization of the text-to-speech (TTS) module within the application. By adding a dedicated `__init__.py` file, the developer can control how this module is imported and used elsewhere in the codebase. This practice helps maintain clean imports and encapsulates related functionality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `__init__.py` ensures that the TTS router is easily accessible when importing the `tts` package. For example, other parts of the application can now import just `from app.tts import router`, making the code more modular and easier to manage.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change introduces a new file, it does not inherently introduce any significant risks. However, developers should ensure that the `__init__.py` file is properly maintained as the TTS module evolves, especially if additional sub-modules are added in the future. Additionally, the copyright notice at the top of the file may need to be updated regularly to reflect current year values.

Overall, this change aligns with best practices for organizing Python modules and should not impact existing functionality unless new dependencies or interactions arise from the addition of `__init__.py`.
