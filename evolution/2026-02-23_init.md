## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `backend/core/websocket/__init__.py`, two new imports (`FileProgressUpdate` and `FileProgressPayload`) were added, along with a new function `init_publisher`. The list of public symbols in the `__all__` variable was also updated to include these additions.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces support for file-level progress updates in addition to batch-level updates. The addition of `FileProgressUpdate` and `FileProgressPayload` suggests that there is now a need to track progress at the individual file level during uploads, possibly to provide more granular feedback or handle partial failures better.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new symbols will allow for more detailed tracking of upload progress. This could impact how the WebSocket server handles and communicates with clients regarding specific files within an upload batch. The `init_publisher` function might be used to configure a publisher specifically for file-level updates, ensuring that they are handled separately from batch-level updates.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a risk of introducing complexity in the codebase if not all parts of the system are updated to handle these new symbols and functions. Additionally, ensuring that `init_publisher` is correctly used and configured could be a potential source of bugs if not thoroughly tested.
