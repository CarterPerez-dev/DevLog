Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `app/core/alerts` directory in the backend project. This file contains a single variable definition, `ALERTS_CHANNEL = "alerts"`, which is likely used for configuring or initializing the alerting system.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change was made as part of completing Phase 1 of the threat detection pipeline, specifically to set up the initial configuration for the alert dispatcher. The file name and variable suggest that this initialization script will be crucial for setting up the communication channel between different components of the system, possibly using Redis pub/sub.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `__init__.py` ensures that the alerts module is properly initialized when imported, which is essential for establishing the alerting pipeline. This setup likely enables seamless integration with other parts of the application, such as the WebSocket and REST API endpoints for alerts.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change appears to be a straightforward initialization step, there are potential risks:
- **Dependency Management:** The variable `ALERTS_CHANNEL` might need to be dynamically configured based on environment variables or other settings.
- **Security:** Ensure that the alert channel is properly secured and does not expose sensitive information.

Overall, this change is part of the initial setup for a robust threat detection system and should be reviewed for any necessary adjustments.
