### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `src/stripe_referral/__init__.py` was added to the repository. This file contains metadata and imports essential components of a framework-agnostic referral program package that integrates with Stripe Connect.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces initial setup for organizing and managing dependencies within the project. The new file serves as an entry point, making it easier to import necessary classes and functions from sub-modules like `config`, `database`, `services`, and `exceptions`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly alter existing functionality but improves modularity and maintainability by centralizing imports. It allows other parts of the application to easily access core functionalities such as `ReferralService` and `PayoutService`.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure that all imported modules are correctly referenced and available.
- **Version Control:** The version number is set to "0.1.0", which may indicate early development stages; ensure this aligns with the project's release strategy.

Overall, this change enhances organizational structure without introducing significant risks.
