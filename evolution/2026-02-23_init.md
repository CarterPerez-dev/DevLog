### Change Analysis for Commit 8c757802

**What was Changed:**
A new file `__init__.py` was added to the `backend/app/core/` directory with a simple docstring.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely serves as an initialization file for the `core` package. In Python, an `__init__.py` file in a directory marks it as a Python package and can be used to define package-level imports or other initialization logic.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly affect the behavior of any existing code but sets up the structure for potential future enhancements. For instance, it could be used to import submodules, define global constants, or set up package-wide configurations.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Documentation:** The docstring is minimal and does not provide much context about what this package contains or how it should be used.
- **Maintenance:** Without additional content in the `__init__.py`, there might be confusion about its purpose, leading to potential misuse or neglect.

Overall, while this change is straightforward, ensuring that future additions are well-documented and serve a clear purpose will help maintain code quality.
