## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis for `responses.py`

**What was Changed:**
The file `backend/app/core/responses.py` has been added, introducing four new dictionaries (`AUTH_401`, `FORBIDDEN_403`, `NOT_FOUND_404`, and `CONFLICT_409`) that define HTTP error responses. Each dictionary maps an HTTP status code to a schema model and description.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize the handling of common HTTP errors in the application. By defining these responses, the developers can ensure consistent error messages and structures across different parts of the API.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These new response definitions will be used throughout the application whenever specific HTTP status codes need to be returned. This improves code readability and maintainability by centralizing error handling logic.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Adding more dictionaries might increase maintenance overhead if not managed properly.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring all parts of the application use these definitions consistently is crucial for maintaining a uniform API response structure.
- **Future Changes:** If new status codes need to be added, they should follow this pattern to maintain consistency.

Overall, this change enhances the robustness and clarity of error handling in the application.
