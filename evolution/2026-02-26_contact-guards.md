## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 5-20 were removed, and a new import statement for `contactSubmissionResponseSchema` was added at line 3. The function `isValidContactSubmissionResponse` was modified to use Zod's schema validation instead of manual type checking.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to leverage the robust validation capabilities provided by Zod, which can handle complex schemas more effectively than manual type checks. This refactor simplifies the code and potentially enhances its reliability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The function now uses Zod's `safeParse` method to validate the input data against the defined schema (`contactSubmissionResponseSchema`). If the validation passes, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. The behavior remains similar but is more robust and easier to maintain.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency on Zod:** Introducing Zod as a dependency might increase the project's complexity.
- **Validation Failure Handling:** Ensure that validation failures are handled appropriately in downstream code.
- **Schema Definition Location:** The schema definition (`contactSubmissionResponseSchema`) is now imported, which means it must be correctly defined elsewhere in the codebase.

Overall, this change improves the validation process by utilizing a more powerful and flexible library.
