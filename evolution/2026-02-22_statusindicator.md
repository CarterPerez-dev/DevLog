### Change Analysis for `StatusIndicator.tsx`

**What was Changed:**
The entire file content was removed, including the import statements, interface definitions, and function implementation.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates a refactor or removal of this component. The absence of any code suggests that the functionality provided by `StatusIndicator` has either been moved to another file or completely replaced with a different implementation.

**Impact on Behavior:**
Since the entire component definition is removed, any usage of `StatusIndicator` in other parts of the application will now result in an error until it is re-implemented. This could disrupt functionality if this component was being used extensively.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Breaking Changes:** Other components that depend on `StatusIndicator` may break due to its removal.
- **Documentation Loss:** If there were specific details about the implementation, those are now lost.
- **Testing Impact:** Any tests related to `StatusIndicator` will need to be updated or removed.

This change should ideally come with a corresponding update in other parts of the codebase to ensure smooth transition and avoid runtime errors.
