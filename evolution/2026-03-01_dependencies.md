+
+FastAPI dependency injection integration for rate limiting
+
+Provides three patterns for wiring rate limits into FastAPI routes.
+RateLimitDep is a callable class you pass to Depends() for
+per-route limits. create_rate_limit_dep() is a factory that
+builds those callables. ScopedRateLimiter groups endpoints by
+prefix (like "/auth") with shared limits and burst overrides.
+Also provides a global limiter singleton via set_global_limiter()
+and get_limiter().
+
+Key exports:
+  RateLimitDep - callable dependency for per-route limits
+  create_rate_limit_dep() - factory for RateLimitDep instances
+  ScopedRateLimiter - per-prefix endpoint group limiter
+  set_global_limiter() / get_limiter() - singleton management
+  require_rate_limit() - simple dependency using defaults
+
+Connects to:
+  limiter.py - imports RateLimiter
+  types.py - imports RateLimitResult, RateLimitRule

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The file `dependencies.py` in the `fastapi_420` module of the `PROJECTS/advanced/api-rate-limiter` repository has been modified to add extensive documentation and introduce several new classes and functions for rate limiting in FastAPI. Specifically, it now includes:

- A callable class `RateLimitDep`.
- A factory function `create_rate_limit_dep()`.
- A class `ScopedRateLimiter` for managing rate limits by endpoint prefix.
- Singleton management via `set_global_limiter()` and `get_limiter()`.
- A simple dependency `require_rate_limit()`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to enhance the flexibility and manageability of rate limiting within FastAPI applications. By providing various patterns for integrating rate limits, developers can more easily control how requests are limited based on specific routes or groups of endpoints.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new classes and functions will allow for finer-grained control over rate limiting behavior in the API. Developers can now specify per-route limits, manage shared limits across endpoint prefixes, and even set global defaults.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Complexity Increase:** The addition of multiple new classes and functions may introduce complexity, potentially making the code harder to understand.
- **Documentation Dependency:** Since this commit includes extensive documentation, it’s crucial that developers read through these details to effectively use the new features.
- **Potential Bugs:** With more functionality comes a higher risk of introducing bugs if not thoroughly tested.

Overall, while this change significantly enhances rate limiting capabilities, careful testing and thorough understanding are necessary.
