### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `red-recon/app/(app)/partner-setup.tsx`, lines 252-257 were modified to include new properties in the `data` object being passed to `createPartner.mutate`. Specifically, five new boolean and string properties were added:
```typescript
notification_period_reminder: true,
notification_pms_alert: true,
notification_ovulation_alert: false,
reminder_days_before: 3,
timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely aim to enable notifications for period reminders and PMS alerts, while disabling ovulation alerts. The `reminder_days_before` property suggests a specific number of days before the expected period start date when these reminders should be sent. Additionally, setting the `timezone` ensures that all time-related alerts are based on the user's local timezone.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change will enable users to receive notifications for their period and PMS cycles, with an option to set a reminder 3 days before their expected period start date. The ovulation alert is disabled by default. This could improve user engagement and awareness of their cycle phases.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **User Privacy:** Collecting the user's timezone might raise privacy concerns if not handled properly.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that all parts of the application consistently use these new properties to avoid inconsistencies in behavior.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the impact on notifications and ensure they behave as expected across different time zones.

Overall, this change enhances user experience by providing relevant cycle-related alerts, but careful consideration should be given to privacy and consistency.
