### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 5-16 were modified to replace the `ContactSubmissionResponse` interface with a Zod schema definition and an inferred type. The original response interface was split into a schema and its corresponding type.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to leverage Zod for validation, ensuring that responses conform to expected structures. Using Zod can provide more robust type checking and validation at runtime, enhancing the reliability of data handling in the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of response validation has shifted from static TypeScript types to dynamic Zod schemas. This change ensures that any `ContactSubmissionResponse` object will be validated against the schema before being used, potentially catching errors earlier in the development process.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that existing code using `ContactSubmissionResponse` does not break due to the type changes.
- **Error Handling:** Zod validation failures need proper handling to avoid runtime issues. Developers should implement error management strategies for Zod validation errors.
- **Performance Impact:** While Zod is generally efficient, there might be a slight performance overhead during validation.

This refactor enhances the robustness of data handling while maintaining type safety and adding runtime validation capabilities.
