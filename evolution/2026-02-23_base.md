### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `base.py` was added to the `stripe_referral/adapters` directory. This file introduces an abstract base class `PayoutAdapter`, which defines two abstract methods: `send_payout` and `validate_recipient`. The class includes type hints for method arguments and return types.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to establish a standardized interface for payout adapters, ensuring consistency across different adapter implementations. By defining an abstract base class with required methods, the code enforces a common structure that all specific adapter classes must follow.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of this base class does not directly alter existing behavior but sets a blueprint for future adapter implementations. Developers implementing new payout adapters will need to adhere to the defined interface, ensuring uniformity in how payouts are processed and validated.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is primarily a refactor, it introduces a dependency on the `PayoutAdapter` class for any new adapter implementation. This could potentially complicate the initial setup of new adapters if developers miss implementing required methods. Additionally, ensuring that all future adapters comply with this interface will be crucial to maintain code consistency and prevent runtime errors.

Overall, this change enhances the structure and maintainability of the codebase by promoting a standardized approach to handling payouts.
