Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/models/base.py`, the line defining the `created_at` field in the `TimestampedModel` class was modified to include a type hint comment `# type: ignore[call-overload]`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely due to an issue with type hints and function calls, possibly related to how the `Field` method from SQLAlchemy is being used. The `type: ignore[call-overload]` comment suggests that there might be a type checking conflict or warning about the way the `Field` method is called.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The change does not affect the runtime behavior of the model, as it only adds a type hint comment to suppress a linting warning. The `created_at` field will still be created with the correct SQLAlchemy configuration and default value.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks introduced by this change. However, it's important to ensure that the suppression is necessary and not masking an actual issue. It would be beneficial to review the type hinting setup in the project to avoid similar issues in the future.

This change appears to be a minor refactoring aimed at improving code cleanliness without altering functionality.
