### Change Analysis for Commit `ea4cc501`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `main.go`, was added to the repository. The content of this file is a simple Go program that imports and calls the `Execute` function from the `internal/cli` package.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents the initial setup for an executable module within the Angela project. By creating a new entry point in `main.go`, the developers are defining how the CLI tool will be launched, which is essential for users to run and interact with the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file introduces a new way to start the application through its command-line interface (CLI). Users can now execute the program directly from their terminal by running `angela` or whatever the executable name is configured as. This change does not affect existing functionality but provides a clear starting point for users and developers.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure that all required dependencies are properly managed, especially if they were previously handled differently.
- **Error Handling:** While not explicitly shown in the diff, it's important to ensure robust error handling within `cli.Execute()` to provide a good user experience and maintain application stability.

This change is likely a feature addition aimed at making the CLI tool more accessible and easier to use.
