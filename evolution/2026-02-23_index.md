### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit adds an `export * from './useNotifications'` line to the `index.ts` file in the `red-recon/src/shared/hooks` directory. This introduces a new hook called `useNotifications`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide developers with a convenient way to manage notifications within their components without having to import and use multiple notification-related functions directly.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Request Permissions on Mount:** The `useNotifications` hook will now request necessary permissions when the component mounts.
- **Schedule Notifications:** It will schedule notifications based on changes in cycle/partner data.
- **Re-schedule on Foreground:** The hook will reschedule notifications if the app comes to the foreground, ensuring timely and relevant notifications.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Overhead:** Requesting permissions on mount might introduce unnecessary overhead for components that do not need immediate permission checks.
- **Resource Management:** Scheduling and re-scheduling notifications could impact battery life if not managed properly.
- **API Complexity:** Exposing `rescheduleNotifications` externally may lead to misuse or unintended side effects if not used correctly.

Overall, this change enhances modularity and ease of use for managing notifications but requires careful handling to avoid potential issues.
