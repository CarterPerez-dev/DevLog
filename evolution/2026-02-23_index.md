### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `index.ts` was added to the `hooks` directory under `features/calendar`. This file exports a single hook, `usePeriodForDate`, which is responsible for finding the period associated with a given date.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change introduces essential logging components for calendar periods. By adding these hooks and components, the development team likely aims to enhance the functionality of managing menstrual cycles or other periodic events in the application. The `FlowIntensitySelector` allows users to select different flow intensities (Light/Medium/Heavy), while `PeriodLogSheet` provides a modal interface for creating, editing, and deleting period logs.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these components will enable more detailed tracking and management of periods within the application. Users can now easily log their menstrual cycles with varying intensities and manage their entries through a user-friendly interface.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Complexity Increase:** Adding new features may increase the complexity of the codebase, potentially leading to maintenance challenges.
- **Testing Overhead:** Ensuring these components work correctly in various scenarios will require additional testing efforts.
- **User Experience:** While the new functionality is valuable, it's important to ensure that the UI/UX remains intuitive and user-friendly.

Overall, this change introduces useful features for period logging but requires careful consideration of potential maintenance and testing challenges.
