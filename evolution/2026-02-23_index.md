### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `frontend/src/api/index.ts`, was added to the repository. This file acts as an entry point for API clients, exporting modules from sub-files like `ollama.client`, `tts.client`, and `whisper.client`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely marks a significant milestone in the project, completing MVP v1.0.0. By centralizing API client exports in one file, the codebase becomes more organized and easier to manage. This approach also facilitates better documentation and simplifies import statements across the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this index file does not directly alter existing behavior but enhances modularity and maintainability. Developers can now easily access all API clients through a single point, reducing redundancy in imports and improving code readability.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the change is beneficial for organization, it introduces potential risks if the sub-files are modified without updating the index file. Ensuring consistency between the index and its sub-modules will be crucial to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, as the project evolves, this file may need periodic updates to reflect new API clients or changes in existing ones.

Overall, this change is a positive step towards better code structure and maintainability.
