### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `index.ts` was added to the `red-recon/src/features/calendar` directory, which exports components and hooks from sub-modules. Specifically, the file imports `FlowIntensitySelector`, `usePeriodForDate`, and `PeriodLogSheet`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change introduces a feature module for calendar period logging, likely to enhance user interaction with menstrual cycle data in a health or wellness application. The addition of these components (e.g., `FlowIntensitySelector` for selecting flow intensity levels) and hooks (like `usePeriodForDate`) suggests the goal is to provide more granular control over period tracking.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new components will allow users to select, log, and manage their menstrual cycle data more effectively. The `PeriodLogSheet` component, for instance, enables creating, editing, or deleting periods directly from a modal interface, improving user experience by centralizing period management functionalities.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the addition of these features is likely beneficial, there are potential risks:
- **Complexity Increase:** Adding more components and hooks can increase code complexity, potentially leading to maintenance issues.
- **Performance Impact:** If not optimized, frequent use of these components might impact application performance.
- **User Experience:** Ensuring that the new modal (`PeriodLogSheet`) is intuitive and user-friendly is crucial for adoption.

Overall, this change appears to be a feature enhancement aimed at improving menstrual cycle data management within the application.
