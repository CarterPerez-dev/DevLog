### Change Analysis for Commit c02cb467

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file `index.ts` in the `red-recon/src/core/notifications` directory, which exports all functionalities from `notification.service.ts`. Specifically:
- Added an `NotificationType` enum and a constant `NOTIFICATION_CONTENT`.
- Created `notification.service.ts`, including methods for requesting permissions (`requestNotificationPermissions`), scheduling notifications (`scheduleNotification` and `cancelAllScheduledNotifications`), calculating notifications based on cycle data (`calculateNotificationsFromCycleData`), and scheduling all notifications (`scheduleAllNotifications`).

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize notification-related logic in a service, improving modularity and maintainability. The addition of an enum for `NotificationType` suggests a structured approach to different types of notifications.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new methods will allow the application to better manage and schedule notifications based on user interactions or data cycles. This could enhance user experience by ensuring timely and relevant notifications are sent.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Permission Handling:** Ensuring proper handling of permission requests is crucial, as failing to request permissions might result in no notifications being sent.
- **Notification Overload:** Scheduling too many notifications could lead to a poor user experience. Careful consideration should be given to the frequency and timing of notifications.

Overall, this change improves the application's notification management capabilities while introducing new functionalities that can enhance user engagement.
