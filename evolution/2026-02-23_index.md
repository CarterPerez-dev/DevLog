## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `frontend/src/api/types/index.ts`, a new import statement was added at line 5, importing all types from `./bulk-upload.types`.

```typescript
+export * from './bulk-upload.types'
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change was likely made to introduce or update bulk upload functionality in the application. The addition of this import suggests that a new feature related to bulk uploads is being integrated into the existing API types.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact on behavior will be minimal unless the `bulk-upload.types` file contains definitions for new functions, interfaces, or constants that are used elsewhere in the codebase. These changes would enable developers to work with bulk upload operations more effectively and ensure type safety.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Incompatibilities:** If the `bulk-upload.types` file introduces types that conflict with existing ones, it could lead to compile-time errors.
- **Code Duplication:** Ensure that no duplicate definitions exist between `bulk-upload.types` and other imported files.
- **Documentation:** Proper documentation should be updated to reflect the new bulk upload functionality.

Overall, this change is a feature addition aimed at enhancing the application's capabilities with minimal risk if implemented carefully.
