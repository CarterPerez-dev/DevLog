### Change Analysis for Commit `ca3ce30d`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `dashboard/frontend/src/api/index.ts` was added to the repository. This file exports hooks and types from sub-modules, serving as an entry point for API-related functionality in the frontend.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to modularize and organize the API logic within the React dashboard application. By exporting hooks and types centrally, it simplifies imports across different components and ensures consistency in type definitions.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact user behavior but enhances maintainability and scalability. It provides a clear structure for managing API-related code, making future development and debugging easier.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the change itself is relatively low-risk, it introduces potential issues if the exported hooks and types are not properly documented or used consistently across the application. Ensuring that all components correctly import and utilize these exports will be crucial to avoid runtime errors and maintain code quality.
