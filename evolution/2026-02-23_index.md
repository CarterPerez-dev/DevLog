### Change Analysis for Commit 4d33b24a

**What was Changed:**
Line 4 of `frontend/src/api/hooks/index.ts` was modified to include an additional import statement:
```typescript
+export * from './useBulkUpload'
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates the addition of a new functionality related to bulk uploads in the application. The introduction of a new hook named `useBulkUpload` suggests that developers are enhancing or adding support for bulk file uploads, possibly as part of a feature request or to improve existing bulk upload capabilities.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The inclusion of this new hook will make it easier for components to utilize bulk upload functionality without needing to import the hook individually. This change likely impacts any component that uses hooks from `index.ts`, potentially allowing them to handle bulk uploads more efficiently.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Changes:** If `useBulkUpload` introduces new parameters or returns different data, existing components using these hooks might break.
- **Code Duplication:** Ensure that the newly added hook does not duplicate functionality already available in other hooks.
- **Testing:** Verify that tests for both the old and new hooks are up-to-date to catch any regressions.

Overall, this change appears to be a feature addition aimed at improving bulk upload capabilities within the application.
