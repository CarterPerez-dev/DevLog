Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `api/hooks/index.ts` was added to the `dashboard/frontend/src/api/hooks/` directory. This file exports several custom hooks (`useStats`, `useRepos`, `useRecent`, `useActivity`, and `useWebSocket`) that will be used in various parts of the React dashboard.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of these hooks is likely to centralize reusable logic for fetching data, managing WebSocket connections, and handling activity streams. This modular approach improves code organization and reusability across different components of the dashboard.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These hooks will enable the React components in the dashboard to more easily interact with the FastAPI backend. For example, `useStats` might fetch statistical data from the API, while `useWebSocket` could handle real-time updates via WebSocket connections. This centralization simplifies component development and maintenance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change introduces a new file and modular logic, it does not introduce any obvious risks. However, developers should ensure that these hooks are properly documented and tested to avoid future issues. Additionally, the performance impact of adding multiple hook exports needs to be monitored to ensure it doesn't degrade application responsiveness.
