Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `react-scss/src/api/index.ts`, the file header was updated to reflect a new year (2026) and the file name was modified from `index.ts` to `api/index.ts`. The export statement remained unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in the project's metadata, possibly due to a rebase or merge of branches. Updating the year ensures that the code is timestamped correctly for future reference. Renaming the file from `index.ts` to `api/index.ts` suggests a restructuring of the API-related files within the frontend.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change does not affect the behavior of the application since it only updates metadata and file names. The exported hooks remain unchanged, so any functionality relying on these hooks will continue to work as before.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **File Renaming:** The renaming from `index.ts` to `api/index.ts` could cause issues if there are references to the old filename in other parts of the codebase. A thorough search and replace is recommended.
- **Year Update:** While updating the year is a good practice, it should be done consistently across all files to avoid confusion.

Overall, this change appears to be a minor update with minimal risk, but careful review is advised to ensure no unintended side effects arise from the file renaming.
