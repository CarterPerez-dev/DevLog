Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `react-scss/src/api/types/index.ts`, the file now exports types from four new modules instead of two existing ones (`auth.types` and `user.types`). The new exports are `common.types`, `metrics.types`, `backups.types`, and `collections.types`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a refactoring to better organize and modularize the type definitions. By moving types into more specific modules, the codebase becomes easier to navigate and maintain.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is minimal as the exported types are still accessible through `index.ts`. However, developers will need to update their imports accordingly in other parts of the application.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that all dependent components and services correctly import the new type definitions.
- **Documentation:** Given the removal of legacy architecture documentation, there might be a risk of confusion if new team members are not aware of these changes. Consider updating relevant documentation to reflect the new structure.

This change is part of a broader refactor towards a MongoDB management dashboard, likely improving code organization and preparing for future development.
