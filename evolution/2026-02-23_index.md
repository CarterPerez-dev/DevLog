### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `index.ts` was added to the `red-recon/src/features/calendar/components/` directory. This file exports two components: `FlowIntensitySelector` and `PeriodLogSheet`. The changes are in lines 1-7 of the diff.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces a new feature module for calendar period logging, specifically to handle user input related to menstrual flow intensity (`FlowIntensitySelector`) and provide functionality for managing periods through a modal interface (`PeriodLogSheet`). This is indicated by the commit message `feat(calendar): add period logging components`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of these components will allow users to select their flow intensity and manage their period logs directly within the calendar feature. This could enhance user experience, providing more detailed tracking options.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Changes:** Users relying on previous versions might need to update their code.
- **Testing:** New components require thorough testing to ensure they function correctly with existing features.
- **Documentation:** Proper documentation should be added for these new components to aid developers in understanding and using them.

Overall, this change is a feature addition that will likely improve the functionality of period logging within the calendar feature.
