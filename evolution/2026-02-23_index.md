Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `react-scss/src/api/hooks/index.ts`, the export statements were modified to include new hooks (`useMetrics`, `useBackups`, `useCollections`, and `useWebSocket`) while removing older ones (`useAdmin`, `useAuth`, and `useUsers`).

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a shift in the application's focus from authentication-related functionality to MongoDB management features. The new hooks suggest an emphasis on real-time metrics, backups, and collections management.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of older hooks (`useAdmin`, `useAuth`, and `useUsers`) indicates that these functionalities are no longer part of the current implementation. The addition of new hooks suggests enhanced capabilities for managing MongoDB databases, including metrics, backups, and collection handling.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Deprecation Risk:** Users relying on deprecated hooks (`useAdmin`, `useAuth`, `useUsers`) may encounter issues.
- **API Incompatibility:** The change might break existing integrations that depend on the removed hooks.
- **Documentation Gap:** Without clear updates to documentation, developers might struggle with understanding the new hook functionalities.

This refactor aligns with the overall project direction but requires careful management of deprecated code and thorough testing.
