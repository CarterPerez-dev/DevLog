### Change Analysis for Commit 4d33b24a

**What was Changed:**
A new file `index.ts` was added to the `frontend/src/core/components` directory. This file exports all components from another file, `GlobalBatchIndicator`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize component re-exporting in a single location for easier management and maintainability. By using an `index.ts` file, developers can import all necessary components from one place rather than multiple files.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact the application's behavior since it only changes how components are imported. However, it simplifies the import process for other parts of the codebase that need to use these components.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Misuse:** Developers might accidentally overwrite or misplace component imports if they do not understand the new structure.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** While this improves initial setup, changes in `GlobalBatchIndicator` will now require updates in multiple places (both in its own file and in the `index.ts`).

Overall, this change is a refactor aimed at improving code organization and maintainability.
