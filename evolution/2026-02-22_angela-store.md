## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code has been completely removed, specifically the `useAngelaStore` Zustand store implementation and its exported functions. Lines 1 to 117 of the file were deleted.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely due to a refactoring or restructuring of the Angela AI Assistant's state management. The removal suggests that the state logic has been moved elsewhere, possibly into a different store or a more centralized state management solution like Redux.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of `useAngelaStore` will affect any part of the application that relied on this store for managing Angela’s state. Developers using these functions to access and manipulate Angela's state will now need to find an alternative source of truth, which could introduce bugs if not handled correctly.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Breaking Changes:** Any component or service that uses `useAngelaStore` directly will break until the new implementation is integrated.
- **State Management Complexity:** If the new state management solution is more complex, it might require additional setup and configuration, potentially increasing development time.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that any documentation related to Angela's state management is updated to reflect the new structure.

This change should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure smooth integration with the rest of the application.
