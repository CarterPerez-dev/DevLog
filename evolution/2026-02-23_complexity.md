```python
Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

### Change Analysis for `complexity.py`

**What was Changed:**
In the `complexity.py` file, a single line of code was modified to add whitespace around the assignment operators in the logger debug call. Specifically, lines 176 and 177 were updated from:
```python
logger.debug("file_analysis_failed", file=str(file_path), error=str(e))
```
to:
```python
logger.debug(
    "file_analysis_failed",
    file = str(file_path),
    error = str(e)
)
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve code readability and maintain Pythonic style guidelines. Adding whitespace around the assignment operators can make the code easier to read, especially in longer debug messages.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of logging remains unchanged. The message format and content are still the same, with the file path and error details being logged when a file analysis fails.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Code Readability:** While improving readability, this change might be considered stylistic rather than functional.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring that similar changes are applied consistently across other files in the project is important to maintain uniform coding standards.
- **Review Process:** This small change should not introduce any bugs or regressions but still requires review to ensure it aligns with the overall codebase style.

Overall, this change is a minor refactoring focused on improving code aesthetics without altering functionality.
