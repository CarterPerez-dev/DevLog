### Change Analysis for `red-recon/src/shared/components/ui/DottedBackground.tsx`

**What was Changed:**
In the file `DottedBackground.tsx`, the import statement was modified to include `gridConfig` from `@/theme/tokens`. Additionally, the default values for `dotSize` and `dotSpacing` were updated to use properties from `gridConfig`.

```diff
-import { colors } from '@/theme/tokens'
+import { colors, gridConfig } from '@/theme/tokens'
 ...
 dotSize = 1,
-dotSpacing = 16,
+dotSpacing = gridConfig.dotSpacing,
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize the configuration for `DottedBackground` properties. By using values from `gridConfig`, the code can be more consistent and easier to maintain, as changes in spacing or size only need to be made in one place.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the `DottedBackground` component will now use the `dotSize` and `dotSpacing` values defined in `gridConfig`. This could affect the appearance of the background dots if these values are different from their previous default settings. However, since the defaults were changed to match existing configurations, the visual impact should be minimal unless `gridConfig` has been altered.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- If `gridConfig.dotSize` and `gridConfig.dotSpacing` are not defined in `@/theme/tokens`, this could lead to a runtime error.
- The change might break existing customizations if developers were previously setting these values directly. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring that the default values in `gridConfig` align with expected behavior.

Overall, this change appears to be a refactor aimed at improving code consistency and maintainability.
