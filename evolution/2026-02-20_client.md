### Change Analysis for `client.go` in `simple-vulnerability-scanner`

**What Changed:**
Line 202 of the `client.go` file was modified to add a comment `//nolint:gosec` before the line that makes an HTTP request. The original code did not have this comment.

**Why It Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of `//nolint:gosec` is likely due to a linting issue or warning related to security practices in Go, specifically with making HTTP requests. This comment suppresses the linter's warning about potential security vulnerabilities associated with the `http.Do` function.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change does not alter the behavior of the code itself; it merely silences a linting tool’s warning. The `http.Do` call will still proceed as before, making an HTTP request to the specified URL.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change suppresses the linter's warning, it does not address any underlying security concerns that might be flagged by the linter. It is important to ensure that the HTTP requests made are secure and properly handle potential issues such as injection attacks or malformed URLs. The `http.Do` function should still be used with caution, and appropriate error handling and validation should be implemented.

In summary, this change is a defensive measure against linting tools but does not resolve any actual security risks associated with the HTTP request logic.
