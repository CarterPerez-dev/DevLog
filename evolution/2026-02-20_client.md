### Change Analysis for Commit e7d0fae1

**What was Changed:**
The code change in `client.go` involves adding a comment with the `//nolint:gosec // hardcoded OSV API endpoint` directive to two lines, specifically at line 162 and 191. This indicates that the hardcoded URL for the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) API is intentional and should not trigger security linter warnings.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely addresses a linting issue where the codebase's security linters were flagging the hardcoded OSV API endpoint as a potential security risk. By adding the `//nolint:gosec` comment, the developer is explicitly instructing the linter to ignore this specific line.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the function remains unchanged; it still sends HTTP requests to the hardcoded OSV API endpoint. There are no visible changes in how the functions `queryBatch` and `fetchVuln` operate.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the change resolves linting issues, it introduces a potential security risk by hardcoding the API URL directly into the source code. This makes the application vulnerable to changes in the OSV API endpoint without requiring a code update. It is recommended to use environment variables or configuration files to manage such sensitive information.

In summary, this change addresses a linting issue but should be reviewed for potential security implications.
