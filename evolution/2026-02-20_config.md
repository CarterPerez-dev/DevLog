### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code in the `config.py` file at lines 188 to 190 was modified, changing the condition from a simple comparison (`if self.ENVIRONMENT == Environment.PRODUCTION`) to an and operation (`if self.ENVIRONMENT == Environment.PRODUCTION and self.DEBUG`). The error message remains unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to make the logic more explicit by combining conditions using `and`. This could be done for readability or to ensure that both conditions are evaluated, which might have been overlooked in the previous version. It aligns with Pythonic practices of using logical operators to combine conditions.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains the same—raising a `ValueError` if the environment is production and debug mode is enabled. The change does not introduce any new functionality but may improve code clarity for future maintainers.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no apparent risks introduced by this change. However, it's worth noting that the original logic was functionally correct; the change might be unnecessary if the intent was merely to enhance readability without altering behavior. Ensuring such changes do not introduce unintended side effects is always a good practice.

Overall, this appears to be a minor refactoring with no significant impact on functionality or risk.
