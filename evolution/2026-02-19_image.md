### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code change in `image.go` involved updating the import statement for the Docker image inspection type from `types.ImageInspect` to `image.InspectResponse`. Additionally, all functions that utilize this type were updated accordingly.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a refactoring or update within the Docker SDK used by the project. The new type `image.InspectResponse` might provide more detailed or structured information compared to the older `types.ImageInspect`, potentially improving the robustness and clarity of the code.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is minimal as long as the new type `image.InspectResponse` contains all necessary fields from `types.ImageInspect`. The behavior of the analyzer functions should remain unchanged, provided that the new type has equivalent or compatible fields. However, if there are differences in field names or structure, this could introduce subtle bugs.

**Risks:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** If `image.InspectResponse` does not fully match `types.ImageInspect`, it may lead to missing data or runtime errors.
- **Code Breakage:** Ensuring all fields used in the analyzer functions are present and correctly mapped is crucial. Any missing fields could cause issues.

Overall, this change appears to be an update to align with newer SDK versions while maintaining functionality.
