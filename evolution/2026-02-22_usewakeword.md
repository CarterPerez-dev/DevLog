### Change Analysis for `useWakeWord.ts`

**What was Changed:**
In the file `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/assistant/facets/angela/hooks/useWakeWord.ts`, line 5 was modified to change the import statement from `createWakeWordEngine` from the `porcupine` library to `wakeword`. No other changes were made in this snippet.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates a refactoring or update of the wake word engine implementation. The transition from `porcupine` to `wakeword` might be due to:
- A new, more efficient or feature-rich library.
- Internal renaming or restructuring of the codebase.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is minimal since only the import statement was changed. However, any functionality dependent on wake word detection will now use the updated engine provided by `wakeword`. This could introduce changes in how wake words are detected and processed.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Compatibility:** Ensure that the new `wakeword` library is compatible with existing code.
- **Documentation:** Verify if there are any differences in API usage between `porcupine` and `wakeword`.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test wake word detection to ensure no regressions.

Overall, this change appears to be a refactoring aimed at potentially improving the wake word engine.
