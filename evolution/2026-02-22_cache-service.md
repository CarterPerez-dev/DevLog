## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `CacheService` implementation, two method calls were modified to include generic type parameters. Specifically, in lines 464 and 473, the `mset` and `query_async` methods now have explicit type annotations (`::<_, _, ()>` and `::<_, >()` respectively).

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve code clarity by explicitly specifying the generic types used in the method calls. This can help avoid compiler warnings or errors related to unsized types, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of setting cache entries and their expiration remains unchanged. The explicit type annotations ensure that the method signatures are correctly matched, which could prevent runtime errors due to incorrect type inference.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is likely intended to improve code quality, it introduces a risk if the generic types specified do not match the actual types used in `kv_pairs_for_redis` and `pipe`. If these types are incorrectly specified, it could lead to compile-time errors. Additionally, ensuring that all method calls have consistent type annotations across similar functions will be important to maintain consistency.

Overall, this change is a refactor aimed at improving code clarity without altering the underlying functionality.
