### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `tts.client.ts`, was added to the repository. This file contains an import statement that brings in the `synthesizeSpeech` function from another client file (`edgetts.client`). The content of `tts.client.ts` is minimal, consisting primarily of a copyright notice and the import statement.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents a step towards implementing text-to-speech functionality within the application. By importing the `synthesizeSpeech` function from another file, the developer may be preparing to use this function in various parts of the application or possibly integrating external text-to-speech services.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact the application's behavior since it only imports a function without defining any new functionality. However, it sets up the groundwork for using text-to-speech capabilities, which could be crucial for accessibility features or voice-based interactions in the future.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- The copyright notice is from 2026, which might indicate an error if this code was committed before that year.
- There’s a risk of circular dependencies if `synthesizeSpeech` relies on definitions present only in `tts.client.ts`.
- Ensuring the imported function works as expected and integrates smoothly with other parts of the application will be important.

Overall, this change is part of an initial setup for text-to-speech functionality but requires further implementation to see its full impact.
