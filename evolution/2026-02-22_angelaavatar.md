## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code was completely removed, specifically lines 1 to 24 in `AngelaAvatar.tsx`. The entire component definition and its associated imports were deleted.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates a refactor or removal of the component. It could be due to:
- A decision to replace this component with another implementation.
- Simplification of the codebase by removing unused components.
- Integration of a new feature that no longer requires this specific component.

**Impact on Behavior:**
Since the entire component was removed, any functionality provided by `AngelaAvatar` is now gone. This will affect parts of the application that were relying on this component to render a canvas element and handle initialization via `onCanvasReady`.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Breaking Changes:** Any part of the codebase that depends on `AngelaAvatar` will need to be updated.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that any documentation related to this component is also updated or removed if no longer relevant.
- **Testing:** Verify that all tests covering this component are either updated or removed, as appropriate.

This change should be carefully reviewed and tested before merging to ensure the application's functionality remains intact.
