### Change Analysis for Commit `fe44f45e`

**What was Changed:**
In the file `backend/api/domains/content/models/Resource.py`, a new member `SECAI_PLUS` was added to the `Certification` enum class, specifically on line 72.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in the certification offerings or requirements for the CertGames application. The addition of `SecAI+` suggests that this is a new certification track or exam that needs to be supported within the application's logic and data models.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this enum member will impact how certifications are handled in the application, potentially requiring updates in various parts of the codebase where `Certification` enums are used. This could include changes in user interfaces, backend validation, and possibly database schema if certification-related data is stored.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensuring that existing functionality does not break with this new enum member.
- **Data Consistency:** Verifying that any existing data related to `Certification` is correctly updated or handled.
- **Testing:** Additional tests may need to be written to cover the new certification type, especially if it involves specific features or behaviors.

Overall, while this change introduces a new feature, careful testing and validation are necessary to ensure smooth integration.
