### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `Card.tsx` file, several prop values and styles were adjusted. Specifically, border radius, padding, maximum width, and text sizes for various components within the card were altered.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The changes are likely intended to refine the visual appearance of the card component according to design specifications or user feedback. The author may have aimed to make the card slightly smaller and more compact, possibly to better fit into a layout or to align with new design guidelines.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These adjustments will result in a slightly different look for the card. The padding and border radius are reduced, making the card appear more snug. Text sizes are decreased, which could affect readability but may also help in fitting more content within the card's dimensions. The maximum width is also reduced, potentially impacting how cards display on larger screens.

**Risks or Concerns:**
Reducing text size might make the content less readable, especially for users with visual impairments. Additionally, if these changes were made without thorough testing, there could be unintended side effects on other parts of the application that rely on consistent card dimensions and styles. It's important to ensure that these modifications do not break any existing functionality or user experience.
