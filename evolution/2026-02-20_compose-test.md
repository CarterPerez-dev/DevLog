### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `TestComposeAnalyzer_AllFiles` function, lines 632 through 635 were modified to use a more concise and readable assertion style in Go. The original code used an `else` block with a single-line `assert.False`, while the updated version uses a multi-line assertion for clarity.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve readability and maintainability of the test code by aligning with Go's preferred coding style, which often favors more verbose assertions over concise ones. The added line breaks in the assertion make the intent clearer, especially when reading or maintaining the code.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged; the test still checks whether `findings` does not contain any critical severity findings. This is consistent with the original logic but presented more clearly.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks introduced by this change. It primarily affects the readability and maintainability of the code without altering its functionality. However, developers should ensure that such changes do not inadvertently introduce subtle bugs when refactoring similar blocks in other parts of the codebase.
