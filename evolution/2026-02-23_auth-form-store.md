Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The file `react-scss/src/core/lib/auth.form.store.ts` was completely removed and replaced with a major refactor. The Zustand store for authentication forms, which handled login and registration states, was deleted.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely occurred as part of the broader refactoring from an auth template to a MongoDB dashboard. The removal of auth-related code aligns with the commit message's focus on transforming the project into a MongoDB management dashboard rather than maintaining authentication features.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of this store will affect any components or routes that relied on it for handling login and registration forms. Developers will need to update their code to use new state management solutions or directly interact with MongoDB.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Breaking Changes:** Components relying on `auth.form.store.ts` will now break, requiring significant updates.
- **State Management Transition:** Developers must adapt to the new state management strategy (if any) used in the MongoDB dashboard context.
- **Documentation:** The legacy documentation for this file has been removed, which could lead to confusion if not properly managed.

This change is a feature refactor with potential risks due to the breaking nature of removing core functionality. Careful testing and documentation updates are essential post-refactor.
