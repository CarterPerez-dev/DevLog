### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 29 and 30 were modified to use configuration values from `config.elevenlabs.stability` and `config.elevenlabs.similarityBoost` instead of hardcoded numbers.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a desire for greater flexibility in the speech synthesis process. By using configurable settings, the implementation can adapt to different requirements or preferences without hardcoding values directly into the function. This could be part of an ongoing effort to make the assistant more customizable and responsive to varying use cases.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is minimal; the behavior will now depend on the configuration provided for `stability` and `similarityBoost`. If these configurations are not set, the default values from ElevenLabs might still be used. However, this change allows for dynamic adjustment of speech characteristics based on external settings.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a risk that if the configuration values are not properly defined or set, the function could fail to synthesize speech as expected. Additionally, ensuring that all relevant configurations are documented and understood by other developers working on this codebase is important to avoid potential bugs or misconfigurations.
