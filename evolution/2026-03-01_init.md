 __init__.py
 
+Public API surface for fastapi-420
+
+Re-exports all user-facing classes, functions, and types into
+a single top-level namespace so consumers can write
+"from fastapi_420 import RateLimiter" instead of reaching into
+submodules. The __all__ list defines the 28 public names that
+make up the library's API.
+
+Connects to:
+  config.py - re-exports settings classes and get_settings()
+  defense/__init__.py - re-exports CircuitBreaker, LayeredDefense
+  dependencies.py - re-exports all DI integration
+  exceptions.py - re-exports all exception classes
+  limiter.py - re-exports RateLimiter
+  middleware.py - re-exports both middleware classes
+  types.py - re-exports all enums and data types

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `__init__.py`, a significant restructuring of the public API surface for the `fastapi-420` library has been implemented. The changes include re-exporting all user-facing classes, functions, and types into a single top-level namespace. This is achieved by defining an `__all__` list that specifies 28 public names.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to simplify the API for consumers of the library. By consolidating the re-exports in one place, users can now import everything they need with a single statement (`from fastapi_420 import RateLimiter`), making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is primarily on usability rather than functionality. Users of the library will find it easier to work with as they no longer have to navigate submodules to access classes, functions, or types. This change does not alter the underlying behavior but enhances developer experience.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change improves usability, there is a risk that users might inadvertently overwrite existing names in their own modules if they also define variables with the same names as those re-exported from `fastapi_420`. Additionally, ensuring that all relevant classes and functions are correctly included in the `__all__` list is crucial to avoid missing any public API components.
