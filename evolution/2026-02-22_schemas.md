### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `backend/api/domains/account/middleware/schemas.py` file, line 788 of a regular expression pattern and line 808 in a list were modified to include `"comptia_secai_plus"` as an active certification option.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update to the supported certifications for user profiles or account settings. The addition of `comptia_secai_plus` suggests that this new certification is now recognized by the system, possibly due to a recent release or update in the CompTIA SecAI+ v1 exam/certification.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The updated regular expression and list ensure that the `SwitchActiveCertificationRequest` model can validate and accept `"comptia_secai_plus"` as a valid active certification. This change will allow users to select this new certification in their account settings, enhancing the system's flexibility and relevance to current certifications.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a minor risk that the updated pattern might break existing user data if not all previous versions of the certification names are still supported. Ensuring backward compatibility should be verified before deploying this change. Additionally, it’s important to test the validation logic thoroughly to confirm that both old and new certifications are correctly handled.
