## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis for `ea74764c`

#### What Was Changed
In the function `checkEnvironment` of `compose.go`, a single line was modified to initialize an empty `Location` struct within a conditional block. Specifically, lines 448-451 were changed.

```go
- loc := &finding.Location{Path: a.path, Line: itemNode.Line}
+ loc := &finding.Location{
+     Path: a.path,
+     Line: itemNode.Line,
+ }
```

#### Why It Was Likely Changed
This change likely aims to improve code readability and maintainability by explicitly initializing the `Location` struct. This is a common Go idiom, especially when dealing with structs that have multiple fields.

#### Impact on Behavior
The behavior of the function remains unchanged. The `Location` object is still created with the same fields (`Path` and `Line`). This change does not affect the logic or output of the function.

#### Any Risks or Concerns
There are no apparent risks introduced by this change. It merely refactors the code to enhance readability without altering its functionality. However, it's worth noting that such changes should be reviewed to ensure consistency across the project and adherence to coding standards.
