### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The copyright notice at the top of the file was updated from `©CertGames | 2025` to `©AngelaMos | 2026`. Additionally, a block of code related to global state management for error handling was removed. Specifically, lines 162-183 were deleted.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely addresses an issue where the application might be leaking memory by storing the current state of the `useErrorStore` in the global window object. By removing this code, the risk of unintended side effects or memory leaks is mitigated.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of the global state management for error handling means that the application no longer persists the error state globally across sessions. This could affect features that rely on persistent error states between page reloads.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Session Data Loss:** Users might lose their current error state if they refresh the page.
- **Feature Breakage:** Any feature that depends on global error handling will need to be reviewed and potentially updated.
- **Testing Impact:** Automated tests that simulate persistent errors may require adjustments.

This change likely resolves a potential bug or memory leak, but it introduces new considerations for how error states are managed across sessions.
