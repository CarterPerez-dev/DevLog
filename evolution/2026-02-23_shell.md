Added Mongo Express as a sidebar nav item with external link indicator:
- Uses SiMongodb icon in green
- Shows external link icon on the right
- Opens http://localhost:1469 in new tab
- Separated from nav items with subtle border
- Responsive to sidebar collapse state

Users can now quickly access Mongo Express GUI without leaving the app

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `react-scss/src/core/app/shell.tsx`, a new sidebar navigation item for Mongo Express was added. The change includes:
- Importing the `SiMongodb` icon from `react-icons/si`.
- Adding an `<a>` tag with an external link to the Mongo Express URL (`http://localhost:1469`).
- Styling the link with a green `SiMongodb` icon, a label "Mongo Express", and an external link icon.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide users with quick access to the Mongo Express GUI directly from the application. By adding this feature, developers can streamline their workflow, allowing them to manage MongoDB databases without leaving the application interface.

**Impact on Behavior:**
Users now have a direct link to Mongo Express in the sidebar navigation. Clicking on "Mongo Express" will open the URL in a new tab, enabling seamless database management. This change enhances usability and convenience for developers working with MongoDB.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security:** Opening an external link could pose security risks if not properly validated.
- **Environment Dependence:** The hardcoded URL assumes that Mongo Express is running on `http://localhost:1469`. If this environment setup changes, the link will break.
- **User Experience:** While convenient, users might be confused by a new tab opening unexpectedly. Consider adding a confirmation or an in-app version of Mongo Express if possible.

Overall, this change improves developer experience but requires careful consideration of potential risks and dependencies.
