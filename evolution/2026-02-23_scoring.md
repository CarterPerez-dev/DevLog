Commit: ca3ce30d
Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `scoring.py` file, the code block for defining class variables `WEIGHTS` and `PATTERN_BONUSES` has been modified to include additional line breaks within the dictionaries. Specifically, the dictionaries now use more explicit line breaks for readability.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve code readability and maintainability by making the dictionary definitions easier to scan visually. This is a common practice in Python to enhance code clarity without altering its functionality or behavior.

**Impact on Behavior:**
There is no impact on the behavior of the `InterestScorer` class since the dictionaries' structure and values remain unchanged. The scoring logic for code snippets based on complexity, length, nesting, parameters, churn, and novelty will continue to operate as before.

**Risks or Concerns:**
This change does not introduce any functional risks. However, it is important to ensure that similar changes are applied consistently across the project to maintain a uniform coding style. Additionally, while this change improves readability for humans, it may slightly increase the file size and potentially impact performance in very large files due to increased line count.

Overall, this change is purely stylistic and does not affect the program's functionality or performance.
