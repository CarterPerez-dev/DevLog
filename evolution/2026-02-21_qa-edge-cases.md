## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit modifies several test cases in `qa_edge_cases.py` by removing unnecessary whitespace and reformatting the code for better readability. Specifically, lines 388-596 are updated to remove extra spaces around function calls and method arguments.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve code formatting and maintainability without altering functionality. The author might have run a linter or formatter tool that automatically cleaned up the whitespace, ensuring consistent coding style across the project.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The changes do not affect the test logic or expected outcomes of the tests. Assertions remain intact, ensuring that the same conditions are checked as before. This refactoring does not introduce new risks but may help in maintaining a clean codebase and potentially make future modifications easier to review.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is no risk introduced by this change since it only involves whitespace adjustments. However, it's important to ensure that such changes do not inadvertently break any existing tests or introduce subtle bugs due to formatting issues. Regularly running linters and formatters can help catch these kinds of issues early in the development process.
