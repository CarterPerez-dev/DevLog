### Change Analysis for `frontend/src/hooks/useGitHub.ts`

**What was Changed:**
In the `useGitHub` hook, the type definitions of the `Repository` interface were modified:
- The `id` property's type was changed from `number` to `string`.
- The `owner` property was renamed and its type updated to `owner_login: string`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a recent update in the GitHub API where repository IDs are now returned as strings instead of numbers. Renaming `owner` to `owner_login` suggests that this field specifically refers to the login name of the owner, which is more precise and aligns with standard API practices.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The behavior of any part of the application that relies on repository IDs or owner information will need to be updated to handle strings instead of numbers.
- Any logic in `useGitHub` or other hooks/services that expect numeric IDs for repositories should now use string values.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- There is a risk if existing code assumes numeric IDs; this could lead to type mismatches and runtime errors.
- The change may require updates in multiple places, increasing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

Overall, these changes are likely necessary to keep the application compatible with updated API standards.
