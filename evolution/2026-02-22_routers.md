## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** 
The code added an import statement for `checklistRoutes` from the `@/aspects/life-manager/facets/checklist/routes` module and included this route in the main `routes` array.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces a new feature or tool within the CarterOS-Client application, specifically a checklist functionality under the Life Manager aspect. The addition of routes suggests that there are plans to integrate and display checklists as part of the user interface for managing tasks or goals.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The inclusion of `checklistRoutes` will enable users to access and interact with new checklist features within their navigation. This could enhance task management capabilities, providing a structured way to track progress or organize activities.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Changes:** Ensure that the new routes do not conflict with existing ones.
- **User Experience:** Verify that the new feature is well-integrated and does not disrupt the current user flow.
- **Testing:** Adequate testing should be performed to ensure all related features work as expected.

This change appears to be a feature addition rather than a bug fix or refactor, enhancing the functionality of the application.
