## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code added an import for `checklist_router` and included it in the list of routers to be registered by `register_routers(app)`. The imports for other routers like `challenge_router`, `planner_router`, etc., were left unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a new feature or enhancement where the `checklist` functionality is being integrated into the application. The addition of this router suggests that users will now have access to checklist-related endpoints, potentially for managing tasks or checklists within the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The inclusion of `checklist_router` in the list of routers means that any routes defined under `checklist_router` will be accessible via the specified API prefix. This could introduce new functionality for users and administrators, enhancing the overall feature set of the application.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Versioning:** If this is a breaking change, it might require updating client applications to handle the new endpoints.
- **Security:** Ensure that any new routes are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Performance:** Adding more routers could potentially impact performance if not optimized.

Overall, this change appears to be a feature addition rather than a refactor or bug fix.
