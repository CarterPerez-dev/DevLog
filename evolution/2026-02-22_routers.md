Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The `routers.tsx` file was refactored to remove legacy authentication-related routes and replace them with MongoDB dashboard, backup, collections, and slow queries pages. The `ProtectedRoute` component was removed in favor of a simpler `Shell` component for the protected area.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change aligns with the major refactor from an auth template to a MongoDB management dashboard. The removal of authentication routes and addition of new dashboard-related components likely streamline the application flow, focusing on managing MongoDB resources rather than user authentication.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior now reflects a more streamlined navigation experience focused on MongoDB operations like backups, collections, and settings. Users will be directed to the `Dashboard` page by default for unauthorized paths, ensuring a consistent starting point.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a risk that removing the `ProtectedRoute` component might affect route protection logic if not properly replaced with equivalent functionality in the new setup. Additionally, ensuring all necessary API hooks and types are correctly implemented for the new routes is crucial to avoid runtime errors.
