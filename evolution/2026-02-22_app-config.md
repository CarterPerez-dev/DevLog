### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `frontend/app.config.ts`, the line `server.preset` was modified from `"node"` to `"node-server"`. The `resolve` section within `vite` remains unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a shift in how the server is configured for development or production. The `preset` value of `"node-server"` suggests that the configuration now aligns with specific requirements or best practices for a server environment, possibly including additional middleware or settings not present in the `"node"` preset.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The change may affect how the Vite server operates, potentially enabling features like hot module replacement (HMR) and other server-specific configurations. This could improve development experience or production performance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a risk that this change might break existing functionality if the new `node-server` preset introduces incompatible changes. It would be prudent to review the documentation for `node-server` to ensure all required dependencies are installed and configured correctly. Additionally, testing should be performed to confirm that both development and production environments behave as expected.

This change appears to be a configuration update rather than a bug fix or major feature addition, focusing on improving server setup.
