### Change Analysis for Commit 47432c8c

**What was Changed:**
The change modifies the type hint for `uptime_seconds` in the test function `test_health_returns_200`. Specifically, line 26 of `test_api.py` was updated to use a union type (`int | float`) instead of `(int, float)`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in how the uptime value is being handled. Using a union type (`int | float`) is more Pythonic and concise compared to using a tuple for types. It also aligns with modern Python practices where union types are preferred over tuples for specifying multiple possible types.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the test remains unchanged. Both `int` and `float` values will still be valid for `uptime_seconds`, ensuring that the test continues to pass regardless of whether the uptime is an integer or a float.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no apparent risks introduced by this change. The use of union types is generally safer and more readable than using tuples for type hints. However, if the backend logic has specific requirements (e.g., `uptime_seconds` must always be an integer), this change might need to be revisited.

Overall, this change improves code readability without affecting functionality.
