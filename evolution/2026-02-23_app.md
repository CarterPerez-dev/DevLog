Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `App.tsx`, the `HydrateFallback` function was added, and the `RouterProvider` component now includes a `hydrateFallbackElement` prop that uses this new function.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of `HydrateFallback` is likely to address warnings from React Router related to hydration. By providing an element for fallback rendering during hydration, the app can silence these warnings and ensure smoother user experiences.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change improves the handling of initial page loads by providing a fallback UI when hydration fails or takes too long. This enhances the user experience by preventing warning messages from appearing in the console.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change addresses React Router warnings, it's important to ensure that `HydrateFallback` provides an appropriate and visually consistent fallback. Additionally, since this is a significant refactor involving both backend and frontend changes, there could be potential integration issues if not thoroughly tested. The removal of legacy documentation (GO/*.md) might also require updating other parts of the project that reference these documents.

Overall, this change appears to be a quality-of-life improvement for the application without introducing major risks.
