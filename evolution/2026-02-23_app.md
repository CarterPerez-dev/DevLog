Message: v1.0.2: add doc type system, Docker infrastructure, and web dashboard

- Add 11 documentation types (function, class, file, security review, TIL, etc.)
  with weighted random selection so the same codebase generates 10x more unique content
- Add Docker Compose for Ollama (GPU passthrough) + Redis + Dashboard + Nginx
- Add FastAPI backend with REST API, WebSocket live events, and Redis pub/sub
- Add React dashboard with stats, live log, commit feed, repo list, and worm viz
- Add next_scheduled_run logging after each cycle completes
- Update repos config and README for v1.0.2

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis for Commit `ca3ce30d`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `App.tsx` was added to the React frontend directory. This file sets up the main application component, integrating key libraries like `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-router-dom`, and `sonner`. It configures a query client provider, routes, and a toaster for notifications.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This addition likely aims to provide a structured entry point for the React dashboard. The integration of `@tanstack/react-query` suggests an effort to manage state and data fetching efficiently, while `react-router-dom` enables navigation between different views within the application. The toaster component enhances user feedback.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The new file serves as the root component of the React app, ensuring that all other components are properly wrapped in necessary providers and routing contexts. This setup will likely improve the maintainability and scalability of the dashboard by centralizing configuration.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While the addition is beneficial for structuring the application, there's a risk if `queryClient` and `router` dependencies are not correctly initialized elsewhere. Ensuring these components are properly configured in other parts of the codebase will be crucial to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the use of `ReactQueryDevtools` might expose sensitive information during development but should be disabled in production.
