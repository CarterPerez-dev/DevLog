### Change Analysis for Commit `a61e4cd8`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `App.tsx`, was added to the repository. This file contains a simple React component definition that imports and renders an `AngelaPage` component.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely marks the initial implementation of the main application structure for MVP v1.0.0. The addition of the `App` component is a common pattern in React applications, serving as the root component that initializes and renders other components.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of the `App` component sets up the basic framework for rendering content within the application. It ensures that any subsequent components or pages will be nested under this root component, providing a structured hierarchy.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency Management:** The `AngelaPage` component is imported but not defined in this file. This could lead to issues if `AngelaPage` is not properly implemented elsewhere.
- **Code Organization:** While the addition of an `App` component is a good practice, it's important to ensure that all necessary components are well-organized and documented.

This change represents a significant step towards completing the MVP v1.0.0 by establishing the foundational structure of the application.
