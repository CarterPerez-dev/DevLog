### Change Analysis for Commit 3894239b

**What was Changed:**
A new file `edgetts.client.ts` was added to the repository, containing two exported functions:
1. `synthesizeSpeech`: An asynchronous function that takes a string and returns an `ArrayBuffer`. It uses the Edge TTS API to synthesize speech.
2. `checkEdgeTTSHealth`: Another asynchronous function that checks the health of the Edge TTS service by making a GET request to its `/health` endpoint.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely implements functionality for text-to-speech synthesis and health checking for Angela, an assistant aspect in CarterOS-Client. The addition of these functions supports integrating with the Edge TTS API, enabling speech capabilities within the application.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `synthesizeSpeech` allows the application to convert text into spoken audio, enhancing user interaction through voice output. The `checkEdgeTTSHealth` function ensures that the underlying service is operational before attempting synthesis, improving reliability and user experience.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is implemented in both functions, more robust error management could be considered to provide detailed feedback.
- **API Dependency:** Reliance on external services like Edge TTS introduces potential downtime risks. Ensuring fallback mechanisms or local alternatives might mitigate this risk.

Overall, this change significantly enhances the assistant's functionality by adding speech synthesis and health monitoring capabilities.
