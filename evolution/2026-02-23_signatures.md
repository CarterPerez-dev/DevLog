Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In `signatures.py`, the sets defining `BOT_USER_AGENTS` and `SCANNER_USER_AGENTS` were modified to use parentheses for tuple unpacking, rather than braces used in the original code.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to improve readability or adhere to Pythonic conventions. Using parentheses instead of braces can make the code more consistent with common Python practices, especially when dealing with `frozenset`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged as both sets are still defined and used in the same way. The logic for identifying bot and scanner user agents will function identically.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is minor and unlikely to introduce bugs, it's worth ensuring that all other parts of the codebase consistently use parentheses for tuple unpacking when applicable. This can help maintain a uniform coding style across the project. Additionally, if the original braces were intentional (e.g., for some specific reason), they should be verified before making this change.

This update is part of Phase 1's completion and likely contributes to improving code quality and consistency in the backend application.
