## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `_default.py` was added to the `backend/api/domains/games/controllers/terminal` directory, containing a function `generate_default_challenges()`. This function returns a list of dictionaries representing default terminal challenges for a game. The file includes 4 initial challenge definitions, each with detailed parameters like name, type, category, and accepted patterns.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces new gameplay content to enhance the educational value of the CertGames platform. The addition of terminal-based security challenges (e.g., process management, cron job inspection) aligns with the game's goal of teaching cybersecurity skills through interactive practice.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these challenges will significantly expand the game’s scope, providing players with more diverse and realistic scenarios to practice their incident response and system administration skills. This could improve user engagement and learning outcomes.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Complexity:** The addition of detailed challenge definitions may increase code complexity.
- **Maintenance:** Regular updates will be needed to ensure the challenges remain relevant and challenging.
- **Performance:** If not optimized, these new functions might impact the game’s performance.
