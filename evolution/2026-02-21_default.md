### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `backend/api/domains/games/controllers/phishing/_default.py` file, several minor changes were made to dictionary entries in a function that generates phishing examples. Specifically:
- Removed unnecessary line breaks and reindented some keys for consistency.
- Updated the "from" field in one example to use the same formatting as other fields.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The changes likely aim to improve code readability and maintain uniformity across dictionary entries, making the code more Pythonic. This could have been done during a refactor or to align with PEP 8 guidelines for better code quality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These changes do not affect the behavior of the function. The examples generated will still be valid phishing scenarios with the same details and structure.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- While these changes are minor, they could introduce subtle bugs if the removed line breaks were intentional for a specific reason.
- Ensuring that all dictionary entries maintain consistent formatting is important to avoid issues in future modifications.
