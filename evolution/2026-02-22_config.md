## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code added new API endpoints and corresponding query keys for a checklist tool in the `config.ts` file. Specifically, lines 76-82 were modified to include `CHECKLIST`, `ITEMS`, `ITEM`, `LOG`, `LOG_ENTRY`, and `STATS`. Additionally, lines 157-164 were updated to include new keys for `CHECKLIST.ALL`, `CHECKLIST.ITEMS`, `CHECKLIST.DAY`, and `CHECKLIST.STATS`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces support for a checklist feature in the application. The addition of these endpoints suggests that the application now needs to interact with a checklist system, possibly for managing tasks or logs.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new API endpoints and query keys will enable the application to fetch checklist items, log entries, and statistics. This could be useful for tracking progress or managing task lists within the application.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **API Stability:** The new endpoints may need to be tested thoroughly to ensure they handle various edge cases.
- **Deprecation of Old Endpoints:** If old endpoints were used in other parts of the code, they might now need to be updated to use the new `CHECKLIST` related keys.
- **Documentation:** Proper documentation should be added for developers working with these new features.

Overall, this change enhances the application's functionality by adding support for checklist management.
