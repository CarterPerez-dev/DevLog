### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `frontends/react-native-ios/src/core/config.ts` file, line 10-11 were modified to remove the `MMKV_STORAGE_ID` key from the `APP_CONFIG` object.

   KEYCHAIN_SERVICE: 'com.yourcompany.app.auth',
   AUTH_STORAGE_KEY: 'app-auth',
-  MMKV_STORAGE_ID: 'app-storage',
 
   ACCENT_COLOR: '#C15F3C',
 } as const
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The removal of `MMKV_STORAGE_ID` likely indicates a decision to either deprecate or remove the use of MMKV (Multi-Media Key-Value storage) for storing application data. This could be due to performance issues, security concerns, or the adoption of a different storage solution.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change will affect any part of the codebase that relies on `MMKV_STORAGE_ID` for identifying the storage instance. Developers using this configuration might need to update their code to use a new storage identifier or switch to an alternative storage mechanism.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Data Loss:** If MMKV was being used extensively, removing it could lead to data loss if there are no equivalent replacements.
- **Code Breakage:** Any dependent components that rely on `MMKV_STORAGE_ID` will need to be updated, which can introduce bugs if not done correctly.
- **Dependency Management:** Ensuring that all instances of MMKV usage are replaced with the new storage solution is crucial.

Overall, this change appears to be a significant refactor aimed at improving the application's storage strategy. Careful testing and documentation updates should accompany such changes to mitigate risks.
