### Change Analysis for `config.py`

**What was Changed:**
The file `config.py` was added to the repository, introducing a new configuration module for the Angela Wake Word Server. The file defines several constants and variables used throughout the application.

- **Lines 2-3:** Added a docstring describing the purpose of the configuration.
- **Lines 5-10:** Defined default values for `APP_TITLE` and `APP_VERSION`.
- **Lines 12-16:** Configured host and port using environment variables, with fallbacks to default values.
- **Lines 18-23:** Set up paths and detection thresholds based on environment variables.
- **Lines 25-29:** Defined sample rate, frame duration in milliseconds, and corresponding samples.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration settings for the Angela Wake Word Server. By using environment variables, the application can be easily configured without modifying code, making deployment more flexible and easier to manage.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The new configuration file will influence how the server operates:
- The host and port determine where the server listens.
- Detection thresholds affect wake word detection accuracy.
- Sample rate and frame duration impact audio processing.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Environment Variable Dependency:** Relying heavily on environment variables could lead to issues if not properly set during deployment.
- **Default Values:** Default values might need adjustment based on specific use cases, ensuring optimal performance.
