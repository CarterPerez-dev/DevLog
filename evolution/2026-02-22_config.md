Message: feat: transform to MongoDB management dashboard

Major refactor from auth template to MongoDB dashboard:

Backend:
- Fix WebSocket context issue (use context.Background instead of r.Context)
- Add Dockerfile.dev with Air hot reload and mongodb-database-tools
- Update go.mod to Go 1.25
- Add Makefile for mongo and app management
- Add dev.compose.yml for Docker development environment
- Configure mongo-rs.yml for 3-node replica set

Frontend:
- Add HydrateFallback to silence React Router warning
- Update CSP to allow localhost:8080 and ws connections
- Replace auth pages with dashboard, collections, backups, slow-queries
- Add WebSocket hook for real-time metrics
- Add metrics, backups, collections API hooks and types
- Update shell with connection status indicator
- Remove auth-related code (login, register, protected routes)

Removed legacy GO/*.md architecture docs (moved to CLAUDE.md)

## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The `config.ts` file in the backend was significantly refactored to align with the new MongoDB dashboard architecture. The API endpoints were reorganized and renamed, adding new categories like `HEALTH`, `METRICS`, `BACKUPS`, and `COLLECTIONS`. WebSocket-related constants were added, and query keys were updated to reflect these changes.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects a major shift in the application's purpose from an authentication template to a MongoDB management dashboard. The new API endpoints and categories provide a more structured approach for managing database health, metrics, backups, collections, and real-time updates. This refactoring aims to improve maintainability and scalability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The updated configuration will affect how the frontend interacts with the backend. New routes and APIs need to be implemented or modified accordingly. For example, the `DASHBOARD` route now points to a new endpoint for metrics and backups management. The removal of auth-related code suggests that authentication is no longer a focus.

**Risks:**
- **Breaking Changes:** The new API structure might break existing integrations if not updated.
- **Complexity Increase:** Adding multiple new categories (HEALTH, METRICS, BACKUPS, etc.) increases the complexity of the configuration and may introduce bugs during implementation.
- **Documentation:** With legacy documentation removed, developers need to rely on other sources for understanding the system architecture.

This refactoring is a significant step towards modernizing the application but requires careful handling to avoid issues.
