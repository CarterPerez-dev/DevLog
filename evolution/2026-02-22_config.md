### Change Analysis for `config.py` in `Angela-TTS/server`

**What was Changed:**
A new configuration file named `config.py` was added to the repository. The file contains key settings such as application title, version, host, port, and voice selection.

- **Lines 1-2:** Added a docstring explaining that this is the configuration for the Angela TTS Server.
- **Lines 4-6:** Defined constants `APP_TITLE` and `APP_VERSION`, setting them to "Angela TTS Server" and "3.0.0", respectively.
- **Lines 8-10:** Set `HOST` to `"0.0.0.0"` (indicating the server will listen on all network interfaces), and `PORT` to `5002`.
- **Line 11:** Defined `VOICE` as `"en-GB-LibbyNeural"`, indicating the default voice for text-to-speech.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to centralize configuration settings, making them easier to manage and modify. By defining these constants in a separate file, the codebase can be more modular and maintainable.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The application will now start with the specified title and version.
- It will listen for incoming connections on all network interfaces using port `5002`.
- The default voice selected is "en-GB-LibbyNeural".

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Default Voice Selection:** If this default value is hardcoded, it might not be suitable for all environments. Consider adding a way to override the `VOICE` constant.
- **Environment Variables:** It would be beneficial to use environment variables for configuration values like `HOST`, `PORT`, and `APP_VERSION` to allow flexibility in deployment settings.

This change introduces a good practice of separating configurations, but there are potential areas for improvement.
