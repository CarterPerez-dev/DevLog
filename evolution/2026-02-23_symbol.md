### Change Analysis for Commit ea4cc501

**What was Changed:**
A new file `symbol.go` was added to the `internal/ui` package, introducing a set of constant Unicode symbols and a function `HRule`. The constants include various arrow, diamond, gem, star, triangle, check, cross, timer, and divider characters. Additionally, a function `HRule` is defined to generate a horizontal rule based on a specified width.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize the use of symbols in CLI output formatting across the application. By centralizing these symbols in one file, the codebase can maintain consistency and ease future modifications or updates to symbol usage.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `HRule` allows for easy generation of horizontal rules within the UI, enhancing readability and visual appeal of the CLI interface. The constants provide a clear set of symbols that can be used throughout the application, improving code clarity and reducing redundancy.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While centralizing symbols is beneficial, there is a risk if these symbols are not well-documented or if their usage varies significantly across different parts of the application. Ensuring consistent use and updating documentation will help mitigate this risk. Additionally, the choice of symbols should be carefully considered to ensure they align with the application's branding and user expectations.
