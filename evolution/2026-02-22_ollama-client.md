### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `ollama.client.ts` file, line 55, the call to `onChunk?.(data.message.content)` has been removed.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely indicates a refactoring or simplification of the code. The removal of `onChunk?.(data.message.content)` suggests that the function no longer needs to notify an external callback for each chunk of content received from the stream. This could be part of optimizing the code, possibly to reduce unnecessary function calls and improve performance.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The impact is that any external listener registered with `onChunk` will no longer be called for every chunk of content. Instead, only the final accumulated response (`fullResponse`) will be yielded when the stream ends. This change might affect components or services that rely on real-time updates from the stream.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Loss of Real-Time Updates:** Components expecting real-time updates via `onChunk` may not function as intended.
- **Codebase Consistency:** Ensure this change aligns with other parts of the codebase where `onChunk` might be used, to avoid inconsistencies.

Overall, while this change simplifies the stream handling logic, it should be carefully reviewed in context to ensure no functional regressions occur.
