### Change Analysis for Commit `ea4cc501`

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file, `types.go`, which defines several new types and structures:
- `Dependency`: Represents parsed dependencies from a `pyproject.toml` file.
- `UpdateResult`: Holds the outcome of checking one dependency for updates.
- `Vulnerability`: Represents a security advisory for a package.
- `ScanResult`: Aggregates the output of a full dependency scan.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize and centralize the data structures used in managing dependencies, their updates, vulnerabilities, and scan results. It provides a clear, structured way to handle these aspects, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of these new types will impact how dependency management, update checks, vulnerability scanning, and result aggregation are handled within the application. Developers will now have standardized structures to work with, potentially simplifying logic related to dependencies and security advisories.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** New types might break existing code that relies on older data structures.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error handling is implemented for these new types, especially in cases where fields may be missing or invalid.
- **Performance Impact:** If not optimized, the additional structure could introduce minor performance overhead.

Overall, this change appears to be a significant refactoring aimed at improving code organization and maintainability.
