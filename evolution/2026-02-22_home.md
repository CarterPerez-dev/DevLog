## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
- The `useCurrentUser` hook import and its usage were moved to the top of the file.
- The background color styling for `SafeAreaView` was removed, and a new component `DottedBackground` from `@/shared/components` was introduced around the main content.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The changes likely aim to improve the layout or appearance of the home screen. By using `DottedBackground`, the developer might be trying to add a visually distinct background pattern, enhancing user experience. The reordering and grouping of imports also suggest an effort towards better code organization.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The removal of explicit background color styling means that the default background color will now depend on the styles applied by `DottedBackground`.
- The structure of the screen content remains largely unchanged, but the visual presentation may differ due to the new background component.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- There is a risk if `DottedBackground` does not support all necessary styling options that were previously handled by `backgroundColor`. This could lead to unexpected visual changes.
- The removal of inline styles might make it harder for future developers to understand the original design intent without additional context.

Overall, this change appears to be a refactoring aimed at improving code structure and potentially enhancing the user interface.
