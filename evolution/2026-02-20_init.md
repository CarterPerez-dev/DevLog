### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `PROJECTS/beginner/caesar-cipher/src/caesar_cipher/__init__.py`, a single blank line was added between the import statements and the version definition.

```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely a result of code formatting or style adjustments to improve readability and adhere to PEP 8 guidelines, which recommend consistent use of blank lines in source files.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of the blank line does not affect the behavior of the module. It only improves the visual separation between the import statements and the version definition, making the code easier to read.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no risks associated with this change. The modification is purely stylistic and does not introduce any functional changes that could impact the Caesar cipher implementation or its usage. However, it's always a good practice to ensure such changes do not inadvertently affect other parts of the codebase.
