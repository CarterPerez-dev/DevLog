### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file `App.tsx` in the frontend directory, which sets up the application structure for the AngelusVigil threat detection dashboard. The file imports necessary components and providers from libraries like `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-router-dom`, and `sonner`. It configures these to provide query management, routing, and toast notifications.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to streamline the frontend setup for a new project focused on threat detection. By removing auth-related code and reconfiguring with essential components like query client and router, the team can focus on building out the core dashboard functionality without initial authentication concerns.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The `App.tsx` file now serves as the entry point for the application, providing a structured way to manage state, routing, and UI elements. This will likely affect how data is fetched and displayed, and how navigation between different pages in the dashboard works.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Security Risks:** Without initial authentication checks, the application might be vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **User Experience:** Users may encounter unexpected behavior if they navigate directly to certain pages without proper setup.
- **Testing Complexity:** The new structure might require additional testing to ensure all routes and components work as expected.

Overall, this change sets a solid foundation for the dashboard but should be followed by thorough security and functionality tests.
