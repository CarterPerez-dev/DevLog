### Change Analysis for `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/config.py`

**What was Changed:**
Lines 41-50 were modified to add new configuration settings related to model directories, detection modes, and ensemble weights. Specifically:
- Added `model_dir`, `detection_mode`, `ensemble_weight_ae`, `ensemble_weight_rf`, `ensemble_weight_if`, and `ae_threshold_percentile`.
- Updated the `mlflow_tracking_uri` setting.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes likely reflect a shift in the project's architecture or requirements. The addition of new settings suggests that the system now supports more complex model management, ensemble learning, and possibly machine learning tracking using MLFlow. This could be part of an effort to improve threat detection accuracy by combining multiple models.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Model Management:** The `model_dir` setting will affect where models are stored.
- **Detection Mode:** The `detection_mode` setting influences how threats are detected, possibly switching from a single model approach to ensemble methods.
- **Ensemble Weights and Thresholds:** These settings control the balance between different machine learning models used in detection, which could significantly impact the system's performance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- Ensuring that the new `model_dir` path is correctly set and accessible by the application.
- Verifying that the ensemble weights sum to 1.0 for proper model combination.
- Confirming that MLFlow tracking is properly configured to avoid data loss or misconfiguration issues.

Overall, these changes enhance the flexibility and sophistication of the threat detection system but require careful validation to ensure they do not introduce bugs or unexpected behavior.
