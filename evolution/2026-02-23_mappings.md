```python
Commit: 7f35fbd8
Message: feat: complete Phase 1 — rule-based detection pipeline, API, Docker E2E

Phase 1 delivers end-to-end threat detection from nginx log ingestion
through rule-based scoring to REST API and WebSocket alerts.

- API layer: /threats, /stats, /models/status, /ws/alerts, /health, /ready
- Alert dispatcher with Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence
- Typer CLI: vigil serve, config, health
- Integration tests (tailer -> pipeline -> DB round-trip)
- Docker E2E verified: dev.compose.yml stack with all services healthy
- Linting clean: ruff, mypy strict (0 issues), pylint 10/10
- 75 tests passing across 8 test modules

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:** 
In the file `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/core/features/mappings.py`, line 93, the definition of `BOOLEAN_FEATURES` has been modified to use parentheses around the set comprehension instead of braces. This change does not alter the content or behavior of the list but updates the syntax for clarity and consistency.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to adhere to Python's recommended syntax for defining sets using parentheses, which is more consistent with other iterable definitions in Python (e.g., `range()`). The change might have been made as part of a broader code cleanup or refactoring effort to maintain coding standards.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior remains unchanged. Both the old and new syntax are valid and equivalent in this context, ensuring that the set of boolean features is correctly defined and used throughout the application.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no risks associated with this change since it only affects the syntax without altering functionality. However, if other parts of the codebase rely on a specific syntax for defining sets (e.g., using braces), this might introduce minor inconsistencies that should be reviewed during further refactoring efforts.

This change is part of a larger feature implementation, likely improving the overall structure and maintainability of the project.
