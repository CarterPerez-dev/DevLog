### Change Analysis for Commit 8c757802

**What was Changed:**
The commit introduces a new file `common_schemas.py` in the `backend/app/core/` directory. This file defines three new schema classes: `HealthResponse`, `HealthDetailedResponse`, and `AppInfoResponse`. Each class inherits from `BaseSchema` and includes specific fields relevant to health checks and application information.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize the structure of responses used in health checks and API documentation. The introduction of these schemas ensures consistency across the application, making it easier to manage and document different types of responses.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Health Checks:** `HealthResponse` and `HealthDetailedResponse` provide a structured format for health check responses, including status, environment details, and optional database/redis statuses.
- **API Documentation:** `AppInfoResponse` offers a standardized response structure for the root endpoint, providing essential information like application name, version, and documentation URL.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Overhead:** Introducing new schema classes might introduce some overhead in terms of code maintenance and potential performance impacts.
- **Compatibility:** Ensuring these schemas are correctly used throughout the application is crucial to avoid inconsistencies. Misuse could lead to incorrect responses or data validation issues.

Overall, this change enhances the clarity and maintainability of the codebase by providing clear, structured response formats for critical endpoints.
