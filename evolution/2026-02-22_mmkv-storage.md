### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The file `mmkv.storage.ts` has been completely removed, with all its contents deleted.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
This change is likely due to a decision to replace the MMKV storage implementation with another storage solution. The commit message "ios fixes - F*** MMKV btw 🙄" suggests that there were issues or dissatisfaction with using MMKV on iOS.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of this file will affect any part of the application that relies on MMKV for state management and query client storage. Developers will need to update their code to use a different storage solution, which may involve changes in how state is stored and retrieved.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Migration Risks:** There might be compatibility issues if the new storage solution does not support all features used by `mmkv`.
- **Testing:** Existing tests that rely on MMKV will need to be updated.
- **Documentation:** Any documentation related to MMKV usage should be revised.

This change is a significant refactor, and careful planning and testing are required to ensure smooth transition.
