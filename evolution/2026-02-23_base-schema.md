### Change Analysis for Commit 8c757802

**What was Changed:**
A new file `base_schema.py` was added to the repository, introducing two Pydantic schemas:
1. `BaseSchema`: A base class with common configuration.
2. `BaseResponseSchema`: An extension of `BaseSchema` for API responses.

Specifically, lines 7-30 were added, defining these classes and their configurations.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to standardize the structure and behavior of schemas used throughout the application. By creating a base schema (`BaseSchema`) with common configuration settings like `from_attributes` and `str_strip_whitespace`, the developer can ensure consistency in how models are created from database records and how strings are processed.

The introduction of `BaseResponseSchema` provides a template for API responses, ensuring that all response schemas include essential fields such as `id`, `created_at`, and optionally `updated_at`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Positive Impact:** Standardizes schema configurations and ensures consistent handling of common fields.
- **Potential Impact:** Simplifies the creation of new schemas by inheriting from these base classes.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- Over-engineering might occur if too many unnecessary fields are included in `BaseResponseSchema`.
- Inheritance could lead to tight coupling if not managed properly, making it harder to change common configurations without affecting multiple derived classes.
