### Change Analysis for Commit `bfb52633`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `Payout.py`, was added to the repository. This file introduces a SQLAlchemy model class named `Payout` that represents a payout record in the database. The class includes various fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `tracking_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`, and more.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to implement a structured way to track referral rewards payouts within the application. By defining a model with specific fields, the team can ensure consistency in how payout data is stored and managed.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of this model will allow the application to handle and manage payout records more effectively. It provides a clear structure for storing information related to each payout, such as user details, transaction status, and error messages if any. This will facilitate easier querying and management of payout data in the database.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that all required fields are properly populated when creating a new `Payout` record.
- **Performance:** The use of foreign keys and indexes (e.g., on `user_id`) may impact query performance, so careful consideration should be given to these optimizations.
- **Compatibility:** Since this is a new file, it must be integrated with existing parts of the application, such as the `ReferralTracking` model, ensuring that relationships are correctly established.

Overall, this change enhances the application's ability to manage referral rewards payouts systematically.
