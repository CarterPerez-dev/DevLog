### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `constants.py` file, two changes were made to the class definitions and a comment was added.

- A new line was introduced after the `URL_DECODE_CHANGED` constant.
- The `BASE64_CHARSET` definition now includes an additional newline at the end of the class block.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of a blank line in the `ScoreWeight` class might be for readability or to separate different sections of constants. This is a common practice in Python to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The behavior of the `ScoreWeight` class remains unchanged as no logic was modified.
- The `BASE64_CHARSET`, `BASE32_CHARSET`, `HEX_CHARSET`, and `HEX_SEPARATORS` constants are still defined correctly, so there is no impact on their functionality.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- While the changes do not affect the program's behavior, they might introduce minor issues if the blank line causes unintended whitespace in the codebase.
- Ensure that any linters or formatters used by the project are configured to handle these types of changes consistently across the repository.
