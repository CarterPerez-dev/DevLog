## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The `SecOps` decorator usage in the `PhishingExamplesAPI`, `SubmitPhishingScoreAPI`, and `PhishingLeaderboardAPI` classes was modified. Specifically, the parentheses around the arguments were removed from the `@SecOps` decorators.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to streamline the code by removing unnecessary parentheses. This is a common Pythonic pattern where function calls with multiple arguments can be written without parentheses if they are not needed for grouping or clarity.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of these API resources remains unchanged. The `SecOps` decorator still applies its rules and parameters as before, ensuring that the rate limiting and security policies continue to be enforced.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is likely intended to improve readability, it’s important to ensure that removing parentheses does not introduce any unintended side effects. Specifically:
- Verify that there are no cases where the arguments need to be grouped.
- Ensure that the `SecOps` decorator logic remains unaffected by this change.

Overall, this appears to be a minor refactor with minimal risk if the original intent and behavior of the decorators is preserved.
