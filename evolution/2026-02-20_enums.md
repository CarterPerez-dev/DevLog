### Change Analysis for Commit e7d0fae1

**What was Changed:**
In the file `PROJECTS/advanced/encrypted-p2p-chat/backend/app/core/enums.py`, the author modified the import statement and changed the base class of the enums from `Enum` to `StrEnum`. Specifically, the changes were made on lines 3-4 and 17-26.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The change likely reflects a shift towards using `StrEnum` for string-based enums. This is part of Python's recent evolution where `StrEnum` provides additional type safety by defaulting to strings, which can help catch errors at the static type-checking stage (e.g., mypy). The use of `StrEnum` also simplifies the code since it inherits from both `str` and `Enum`, eliminating the need for explicit string annotations.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the enums remains unchanged as they are still used in the same way. However, using `StrEnum` can improve type safety and make the code more readable to static analyzers.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this change is generally beneficial, there's a potential risk if any part of the codebase relies on the specific behavior of `Enum`. For instance, if the enums are used in contexts where their exact class type matters (e.g., isinstance checks), switching to `StrEnum` might break those assumptions. However, given that these enums are primarily used for type safety and readability, this risk is minimal.

Overall, this change enhances the code's robustness without altering its functionality.
