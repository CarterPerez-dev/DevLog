### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the `backends/fastapi/app/factory.py` file, a single line was added at line 132:
```python
+ return app
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of `return app` ensures that the function `create_app()` explicitly returns the FastAPI application object. This change likely addresses an issue where the function might have been returning `None` by default, causing potential issues downstream in the application setup.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change makes the behavior more explicit and consistent with Python's convention of using return statements to provide output from functions. It ensures that any code calling `create_app()` will receive a FastAPI instance, preventing potential bugs related to unexpected `None` values.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this is likely a minor refactor, it’s important to ensure that all calls to `create_app()` are correctly handling the returned object. Additionally, if there were any existing tests or documentation that relied on the implicit behavior of returning `None`, they may need updates.

Overall, this change improves code clarity and reduces potential bugs by making the return value explicit.
