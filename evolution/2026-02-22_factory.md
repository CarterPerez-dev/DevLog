### Change Analysis for Commit `dae6cf01`

In the `create_app` function, a single line was modified to add a space before the `lifespan = lifespan` assignment.

     )
 
     setup_middleware(app)
```

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of a space before `lifespan` likely aligns with Python's PEP 8 style guide, which recommends consistent spacing around operators and after commas. This change improves code readability without altering functionality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change has no impact on the behavior or API of the application. The `lifespan` parameter is still correctly assigned to the FastAPI instance.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no risks introduced by this change. It is a minor stylistic improvement that enhances code readability without affecting functionality or introducing bugs. However, it's always good practice to ensure such changes do not inadvertently introduce issues in other parts of the codebase where similar patterns might be used differently.

Overall, this change is a refactor aimed at improving code style and consistency.
