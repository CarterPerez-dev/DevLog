### Change Analysis for `reporter.go`

**What was Changed:**
A new file `reporter.go` was added to the project, introducing an interface `Reporter` and a function `New` that returns different implementations of this interface based on the specified format.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide flexibility in how scan results are reported. By defining an `interface` for reporting, the code can easily support multiple output formats such as JSON, SARIF, and Terminal without tightly coupling them. This is a common pattern in Go to promote modularity and ease of extension.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file allows the secrets scanner to generate reports in different formats (JSON, SARIF, or terminal) depending on user preferences or requirements. The `New` function acts as a factory for creating appropriate reporters based on the format specified, enhancing the usability and flexibility of the reporting mechanism.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Error Handling:** Ensure that all reporter implementations handle errors appropriately to avoid crashes.
- **Interface Compliance:** Verify that each implementation of `Reporter` correctly implements the required methods without causing runtime issues.
- **Configuration Management:** Users must provide a valid format when calling `New`, otherwise, it will return an invalid reporter.

Overall, this change enhances the project's flexibility and maintainability by decoupling report generation from the core scanning logic.
