## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code in `frontend/src/app.tsx` was significantly refactored to streamline the layout and error boundary components. The manual layout wrapper (`ManualLayoutWrapper`) was removed, replaced with a simpler `LayoutWrapper`. The parallax effect and loading spinner were also removed.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to simplify the codebase by removing unnecessary complexity. By eliminating the manual layout system and its associated signals, the developer may have aimed for cleaner component boundaries and easier maintenance.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- **Loading State:** The application no longer displays a loading spinner during initial render.
- **Parallax Effect:** The parallax background effect is gone, which might affect visual aesthetics but could also improve performance.
- **Error Handling:** Error boundaries remain intact, ensuring that any errors are caught and displayed appropriately.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Aesthetic Impact:** Removing the parallax effect may change the user experience, potentially making the application feel less dynamic.
- **Performance:** Simplifying the layout might improve performance by reducing the number of DOM manipulations and state signals.
- **Testing:** The removal of certain components could impact existing tests, so thorough testing is necessary to ensure no functionality was inadvertently broken.

Overall, this change likely represents a refactor aimed at improving code clarity and potentially enhancing performance.
