### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the commit `294169a2` by CarterPerez-dev, a new file `main.go` was added to the `PROJECTS/intermediate/secrets-scanner/cmd/portia` directory. The file contains a simple Go program that imports and executes the `cli.Execute()` function from the `internal/cli` package.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents the initial implementation of the command-line interface (CLI) for the secrets scanner tool, named "Portia." Adding this entry point is crucial to enable users to interact with the application via the terminal. The copyright notice and package declaration are standard Go practices.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of `main.go` introduces a new executable entry point for the secrets scanner. When run, it will execute the CLI functionality defined in the `internal/cli` package, allowing users to start scanning for secrets using command-line arguments or flags.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Dependency on `internal/cli`:** The code assumes that the `cli.Execute()` function is properly implemented and exported from the `internal/cli` package. Any issues with this function could cause the main program to fail.
- **Error Handling:** While not shown in the diff, proper error handling should be added around `cli.Execute()` to ensure robustness. This includes checking for errors returned by the CLI execution and providing meaningful feedback to the user.

Overall, this change is a necessary step towards completing the Go secrets scanner tool, but thorough testing of the CLI functionality will be essential.
