### Change Analysis for Commit `b886d0ad`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `FlowIntensitySelector.tsx`, was added to the repository. This component allows users to select their menstrual flow intensity (Light, Medium, Heavy) and includes a hook (`usePeriodForDate`) and another component (`PeriodLogSheet`), though only the former is detailed in this diff.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of `FlowIntensitySelector` likely aims to improve user interaction with period data logging. By providing a clear, interactive way to select flow intensity, the application can gather more accurate and useful information from users.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change enhances the user experience by adding an intuitive selector for menstrual flow intensity. Users will now be able to easily choose their current flow type, which is crucial for tracking period-related data accurately.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Consistency:** Ensure that `FlowIntensity` values (LIGHT, MEDIUM, HEAVY) are consistently used across the application.
- **Accessibility:** Verify that the component is accessible and usable by all users, including those with visual impairments.
- **Performance:** The use of hooks like `usePeriodForDate` should be carefully managed to avoid performance issues.

Overall, this change introduces a new feature module for period logging, enhancing data collection capabilities without introducing significant risks.
