### Change Analysis for Commit 4742c8c

**What was Changed:**
Lines 10 to 19 were modified, specifically removing the import statements for `WINDOW_MINUTE`, `DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUESTS`, and `FingerprintLevel` from `fastapi_420.types`. The only remaining import is `Algorithm`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to streamline the test module by reducing unnecessary imports. It could be part of a refactoring effort to improve code clarity or reduce potential conflicts with other modules.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The removal of these imports does not directly impact the behavior of the tests, as `WINDOW_MINUTE`, `DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUESTS`, and `FingerprintLevel` are not used in this test file. The `Algorithm` type is still imported, which is necessary for the test functions that depend on it.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Conflicts:** If these constants were being used elsewhere in the project, removing them here could cause issues.
- **Future Maintenance:** Future developers might find the change confusing if they are not aware of the context. Adding a comment explaining the removal can help mitigate this risk.

Overall, the change appears to be a minor refactoring with minimal impact on functionality.
