### Change Analysis for Commit 47432c8c

**What was Changed:**
In the `test_fingerprinting.py` file, the author modified test cases to remove the assignment of the `raw_ip` variable in two specific tests and added a comment using `# noqa: S106` in one of them. The changes are located at lines 67-75 and 323.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The removal of the `raw_ip` assignment suggests an intention to focus only on the `normalized_ip` value for testing, possibly simplifying the test logic or making the tests more concise. The comment `# noqa: S106` indicates that a PEP8 warning (likely related to unused variables) was silenced.

**Impact on Behavior:**
These changes do not affect the behavior of the code since both `raw_ip` and `normalized_ip` are tested independently. However, it may make the test output cleaner by reducing noise from unused variable assignments.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is no apparent risk in removing the assignment if the tests still pass and the logic remains intact. The comment suggests that this change was made to address a PEP8 warning, which is generally good practice for maintaining clean code. However, it's important to ensure that future changes do not reintroduce unused variable warnings.

Overall, these changes are likely part of improving test clarity without impacting functionality.
