## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `src/stripe_referral/adapters/manual.py` was added, containing a class `ManualBankAdapter`. This adapter handles manual bank transfer payouts and includes methods for sending payouts and validating recipient data.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely introduces support for manually processed payouts via bank transfers. The class ensures that required fields are present in the recipient's bank account information before processing a payout, enhancing security and compliance.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- `send_payout`: Marks payouts as pending manual review and assigns a unique transaction ID.
- `validate_recipient`: Ensures all necessary fields (bank_account_number, routing_number, account_holder_name) are present and valid. If any field is missing or invalid, it returns an error message.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- The hardcoded prefix for the transaction ID (`MANUAL_PAYOUT_ID_PREFIX`) might need adjustment if multiple payout types exist.
- Validation checks could be expanded to include additional fields or more complex validation logic depending on business requirements.
