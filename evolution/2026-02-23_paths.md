## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis for `internal/rules/paths.go`

**What was Changed:**
The file `internal/rules/paths.go` was added, introducing a new Go package that defines paths with associated severity and description information. Specifically, it includes mappings of critical paths related to Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman, and additional container runtimes, as well as sensitive host filesystem directories.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely aims to provide a comprehensive list of paths that could be exploited or misused in a security context. By categorizing these paths with severity levels and descriptions, the code can help identify potential vulnerabilities more effectively. This is part of a broader effort to ensure secure container management and host system configurations.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The introduction of `DockerSocketPaths` and `SensitiveHostPaths` maps will allow for better path-based security checks within the application. Developers or security tools using this package can now easily reference these paths to assess potential risks, thereby enhancing overall security posture.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While this is a valuable addition, it's important to ensure that the mappings are kept up-to-date with new container runtimes and host configurations. Additionally, the severity levels should be periodically reviewed to reflect current best practices in security assessments. There’s also a risk of false positives if paths not listed here are equally critical but were overlooked during this initial implementation.

This change is likely a feature addition aimed at improving security analysis capabilities within the `docksec` repository.
