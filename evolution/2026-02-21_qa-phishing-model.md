## Code Evolution

### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code changes primarily involve refactoring and minor adjustments within the `qa_phishing_model.py` file. Specifically, function signatures were simplified by removing redundant parameters, and some inline comments were added for clarity. Additionally, a few assert statements and list initializations were slightly modified.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
These changes are likely part of ongoing code cleanup and modernization efforts to improve readability and maintainability. Simplifying function signatures and refining test cases can help ensure the codebase remains clean and easy to understand for future contributors.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the `qa_phishing_model.py` class should remain unchanged as these changes are primarily stylistic and do not alter the logic or assertions. The tests will still validate that required fields, optional fields, boolean values, and dictionary outputs behave as expected.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There is a minor risk in simplifying function signatures without thoroughly testing the impact on other parts of the application. However, given that these changes are focused on internal methods and tests, the risk is low. Ensuring all related test cases pass after these modifications would mitigate any potential issues.

Overall, these changes contribute to better code hygiene without affecting external functionality.
