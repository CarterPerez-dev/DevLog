### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/assistant/facets/angela/config/index.ts`, the opening comments were updated to include a copyright notice and a header comment block, while the actual export statement remained unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in the repository's coding standards or legal requirements. The addition of a copyright notice and header comment is common practice to ensure compliance with company policies or licensing agreements. This might also be part of a broader effort to standardize code across the project.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the code has not changed; it still exports all configurations from `angela.config`. The only visible change is in the comments, which do not affect runtime functionality.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are no significant risks associated with this change. However, ensuring that all files in the repository follow these new standards might require additional updates to other files. Additionally, if the copyright year (2026) is incorrect, it could lead to confusion when reviewing the codebase.

Overall, this appears to be a minor update focused on improving code documentation and compliance.
