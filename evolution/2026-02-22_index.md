### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
A new file `index.ts` was added to the `hooks` directory within the `facets/angela/hooks` folder in the `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/assistant/facets/angela/hooks` path. This file exports three hooks: `useThreeScene`, `useWakeWord`, and `useVoicePipeline`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely represents a modularization effort to organize Angela Mos' 3D implementation into reusable hooks. By exporting these hooks in an `index.ts` file, the codebase can more easily manage and import related functionality.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The addition of this file does not directly impact existing behavior but enhances modularity. Users of these hooks can now import them from a single point (`./hooks/index`) instead of individual files.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Maintenance:** Ensuring that the exported hooks are well-documented and maintainable.
- **Dependency Management:** If other parts of the codebase rely on these hooks, changes to their implementation could introduce breaking changes if not managed carefully.
- **Testing:** Additional tests may be needed for each hook to ensure they function as expected.

This change is likely a refactor aimed at improving code organization without altering existing functionality.
