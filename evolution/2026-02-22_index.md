### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
In the file `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/assistant/facets/angela/types/index.ts`, the comment block at the top of the file was updated to include a copyright notice and a more descriptive header. The import statements for exporting enums and types from sub-files remained unchanged.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely reflects an update in the repository's coding standards or legal requirements, such as adding a copyright year and updating the file description. It may also be part of a broader effort to standardize comment blocks across the project.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of the code remains unchanged since no functionality was modified. The import statements still correctly export `angela.enums` and `angela.types`.

**Risks or Concerns:**
There are minimal risks associated with this change, as it only affects comments. However, ensure that the copyright year is updated to reflect the current year before committing. Additionally, verify that all other files in the repository follow a consistent comment structure for uniformity.

This change appears to be purely stylistic and does not introduce any functional or security risks.
