### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 1-7 were modified, changing the comment block and file export statements. Specifically:
- The original comment `@AngelaMos | 2026` was replaced with a new comment style.
- The import statement for `mmkv.storage` was removed.
- A new export statement for `app.storage` was added.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The commit message "ios fixes - F*** MMKV btw 🙄" suggests that this change is part of iOS-specific bug fixes or improvements. Removing the `mmkv.storage` import and adding an `app.storage` export likely addresses issues related to storage mechanisms on iOS, possibly replacing or refactoring how data is stored.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The removal of `mmkv.storage` might indicate a change in the storage strategy for iOS.
- The addition of `app.storage` suggests a new or updated storage solution that could affect application behavior and data handling.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- There's a risk that removing `mmkv.storage` without a clear replacement could break existing functionality if not properly tested.
- Adding an untested `app.storage` export might introduce bugs, especially if it interacts with other parts of the codebase in unexpected ways.
