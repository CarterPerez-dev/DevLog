### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
- The `ios fixes - F*** MMKV btw 🙄` commit modified the `index.ts` file in the `frontends/react-native-ios/src/shared/components/ui/` directory.
  - Removed and then re-exported `Card`.
  - Added an export for `DottedBackground`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
- The removal and re-export of `Card` might be due to a refactoring or correction in the component structure. The addition of `DottedBackground` suggests a new feature or UI element being introduced.
- The commit message "F*** MMKV btw 🙄" indicates that there may have been issues with MMKV (a key-value storage library), possibly related to iOS-specific fixes.

**Impact on Behavior:**
- The re-export of `Card` likely ensures its availability in the component namespace without needing to import it from a specific file.
- Adding `DottedBackground` introduces a new UI element, which could be used for background styling or visual effects.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- There is a risk that removing and then re-exporting `Card` might cause confusion if not properly documented. Ensure the reason for this change is clear in the codebase.
- The addition of `DottedBackground` should be carefully tested to ensure it integrates well with existing components and does not introduce any visual or functional issues.

Overall, while the changes seem minor, they could have significant implications depending on how these components are used throughout the application.
