### Change Analysis for Commit `dae6cf01`

**What was Changed:**
A new file, `index.ts`, was added to the `CarterOS-Client/src/aspects/life-manager/facets/checklist/components` directory. This file exports three components: `ChecklistItem`, `StatsPanel`, and `HeatmapGrid`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
The addition of this file suggests an expansion or enhancement in the life management aspect of CarterOS, specifically focusing on a checklist tool. The new components likely provide functionality to manage tasks, display statistics related to task completion, and visualize data using a heatmap.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change introduces new functionalities for managing checklists within the application. Users will now have access to detailed task tracking, performance metrics, and visual representations of their progress or workload distribution.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Code Integration:** The components need to be properly integrated into existing parts of the application.
- **Performance Impact:** Additional UI elements could potentially impact the overall performance if not optimized well.
- **Documentation:** Adequate documentation should be provided for these new components, especially since they are part of a new feature.

Overall, this change appears to be a strategic addition aimed at improving task management and user experience within CarterOS.
