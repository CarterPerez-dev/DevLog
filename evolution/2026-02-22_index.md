### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
Lines 1-7 were replaced with a new comment block, and two additional `export *` statements were added at the end of the file. Specifically:
- Added copyright notice and file name comments.
- Introduced exports for `tts.client` and `edgetts.client`.

**Why it Was Likely Changed:**
The addition of these export statements suggests that the implementation of text-to-speech (TTS) functionality using both `tts.client` and `edgetts.client` has been completed. The copyright notice indicates a recent update, likely to align with new licensing or ownership terms.

**Impact on Behavior:**
This change expands the API surface by including TTS capabilities from two different clients (`tts.client` and `edgetts.client`). Users of this module now have access to more speech synthesis options, potentially improving the flexibility and robustness of the Angela AI Assistant's voice output functionality.

**Risks or Concerns:**
- **Potential Conflicts:** With multiple TTS implementations, there could be potential conflicts if they share similar interfaces.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Adding new client exports increases maintenance complexity. Ensure that both `tts.client` and `edgetts.client` are well-documented and tested.

Overall, this change enhances the functionality of the assistant by providing more options for text-to-speech processing.
