### Change Analysis

**What was Changed:**
The code modification in `update.go` at lines 134-135 involves a comment change and the addition of a `//nolint:gosec` directive to suppress a security linting warning for writing the file `pyproject.toml`. The file permissions are explicitly set to `0o644`.

**Why it was Likely Changed:**
This change likely addresses a specific requirement or constraint where the `pyproject.toml` file must have exactly 0644 permissions. Suppressing the security linting warning indicates that this permission setting is intentional and necessary for the project's workflow, possibly due to compatibility with other tools like `uv` or `pip`.

**Impact on Behavior:**
The behavior of writing the `pyproject.toml` file remains unchanged in terms of content, but now explicitly sets its permissions to 0644. This ensures that the file is readable and writable only by the owner, which aligns with typical security practices for configuration files.

**Risks or Concerns:**
While setting specific file permissions can be necessary, suppressing a security linting warning might introduce risks if it leads to overlooking potential security issues elsewhere in the codebase. It's important to ensure that this change does not compromise overall security and that other critical parts of the project are still properly secured.
