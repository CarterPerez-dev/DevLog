## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/security

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains models related to security features in the application, including token management, rate limiting, data retention policies, IP blocklisting, and security events.

## File Relationships
- **ActiveTokenCount.py**: Manages real-time counts of active tokens.
- **DataRetention.py**: Handles data retention policies for sensitive information.
- **IPBlocklist.py**: Implements a list of blocked IP addresses to prevent unauthorized access.
- **RateLimit.py**: Manages rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **SecurityEvent.py**: Tracks security-related events, such as login attempts or suspicious activities.
- **TokenBlocklist.py**: Stores tokens that have been revoked or should not be used.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes for managing active token counts (`ActiveTokenCount`), global rate limits (`GlobalRateLimit`), token blocklists (`TokenBlocklist`), security events (`SecurityEvent`), data retention policies (`DataRetention`), and IP blocklisting (`IPBlocklist`). These classes are imported in the `__init__.py` file, making them easily accessible.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending security features in the application. For example, they might use `TokenBlocklist` to manage revoked tokens or configure rate limits via `GlobalRateLimit`. This package is particularly useful for backend administrators who need fine-grained control over user access and system security.
