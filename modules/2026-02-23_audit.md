## Module Overview

### backend/api/admin/models/audit

#### Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/admin/models/audit` package is part of the security models within the CertGames-Core repository. It focuses on managing audit logs, which are crucial for tracking administrative actions and ensuring data integrity.

#### File Relationships
- **AuditLog.py**: This file contains the implementation of the `AuditLog` class, responsible for recording detailed information about administrative activities.
- **__init__.py**: Serves as an entry point for the package. It imports and exports the `AuditLog` class to ensure it is accessible from outside this module.

#### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- **AuditLog**: A class designed to log administrative actions with detailed information such as user, timestamp, action type, and affected entities.

```python
from datetime import datetime

class AuditLog:
    def __init__(self, user: str, action_type: str, entity_id: int):
        self.user = user
        self.action_type = action_type
        self.entity_id = entity_id
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

    # Additional methods for logging and retrieving audit logs can be added here.
```

#### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or integrate administrative actions that require detailed tracking. For example, when creating or updating user records, performing database operations, or managing system configurations, the `AuditLog` class can be used to log these activities.

This ensures that all critical administrative actions are recorded for audit and compliance purposes.
