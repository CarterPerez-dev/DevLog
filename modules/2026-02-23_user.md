## Module Overview

### backends/fastapi/app/user

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package is part of the `fullstack-template` project, specifically handling user-related functionalities within the FastAPI application. It encapsulates domain logic for users, including data models, services, dependencies, repositories, and API routes.

**File Relationships:**
- **User.py:** Defines the User model with type hints.
- **__init__.py:** Initializes the package and imports key components to make them accessible.
- **dependencies.py:** Contains dependency injection functions used across the module.
- **repository.py:** Implements database interactions for user data, abstracting away specific storage mechanisms.
- **routes.py:** Defines FastAPI routes related to users, connecting them with services via dependencies.
- **schemas.py:** Houses Pydantic schemas for validating and serializing user data.
- **service.py:** Contains business logic for user operations.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes the `User` model from `User.py`, dependency injection functions from `dependencies.py`, repository methods from `repository.py`, routes defined in `routes.py`, and validation schemas from `schemas.py`.

**When to Use:**
Developers would interact with this package when they need to implement or extend user-related features in their FastAPI application. This includes setting up database interactions, defining API endpoints for CRUD operations on users, and ensuring data integrity through robust validation and business logic.
