## Module Overview

### User Module Documentation

**Package Purpose and Scope:**
The `user` package in the `stacks/fastapi-react/backend/app/user` directory is part of a full-stack application using FastAPI for the backend. It encapsulates all logic related to user management, including authentication, data validation, repository interactions, and API routing.

**File Relationships:**
- **User.py**: Contains the User model class with type hints and methods.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and makes its contents accessible.
- **dependencies.py**: Defines dependencies required for user-related operations, such as token verification.
- **repository.py**: Implements data access logic using SQLAlchemy to interact with a database.
- **routes.py**: Exposes API endpoints for user management through FastAPI.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for validating user input and output data.
- **service.py**: Provides business logic and orchestrates interactions between the repository, schemas, and routes.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface includes:
- User model methods in `User.py`.
- Dependency injection functions in `dependencies.py`.
- Repository operations in `repository.py`.
- Route definitions in `routes.py`.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending user-related features, such as creating new users, managing user authentication, and handling user data. It provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend the application's user management functionality.
