## Module Overview

# ml

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `ml` package is part of the backend for an AI threat detection system, focusing on machine learning components such as autoencoders and classifiers.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **autoencoder.py**: Contains classes and functions related to building and training autoencoders.
- **scaler.py**: Implements data scaling utilities for preprocessing input data.
- **train_autoencoder.py**: Script for training autoencoders using predefined configurations.
- **train_classifiers.py**: Script for training various classifiers on preprocessed data.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes classes and functions from `autoencoder.py` and `scaler.py`. Developers can import and use these to preprocess data and train models. The scripts in `train_autoencoder.py` and `train_classifiers.py` are primarily used for training purposes and may not be directly imported.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when setting up the machine learning pipeline, particularly when they need to preprocess data using scalers or train autoencoders. The scripts in `train_autoencoder.py` and `train_classifiers.py` are used for training models but can be run as standalone scripts during development.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the machine learning components of the threat detection system.
