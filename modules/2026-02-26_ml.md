## Module Overview

# ml

## Purpose and Scope
The `ml` package is part of the backend for an AI threat detection system. It focuses on training machine learning models, specifically autoencoders and classifiers, which are crucial for identifying anomalies in network traffic data.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package, importing key classes and functions from other modules.
- **autoencoder.py**: Contains the implementation of an autoencoder model used for anomaly detection.
- **scaler.py**: Provides utilities to preprocess data before feeding it into machine learning models.
- **train_autoencoder.py**: Script responsible for training the autoencoder using network traffic data.
- **train_classifiers.py**: Script that trains various classifiers on preprocessed data, leveraging the output from `autoencoder.py`.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Autoencoder model classes and methods in `autoencoder.py`.
- Data scaling utilities in `scaler.py`.
- Training functions for autoencoders and classifiers.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when setting up the machine learning pipeline. Specifically, they would use it during the initial setup of the project to train models on raw data, or when updating model parameters based on new datasets.
