## Module Overview

# PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/tests

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains comprehensive test cases for the backend components of the AI Threat Detection system, ensuring robustness and reliability in threat detection algorithms and services.

## File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the tests package.
- **`conftest.py`**: Contains shared fixtures and setup configurations used across multiple test files.
- **`test_api.py`, `test_detection.py`, `test_features.py`, `test_geoip.py`, `test_integration.py`, `test_parsers.py`, `test_pipeline.py`**: Individual test modules that cover specific backend functionalities such as API responses, detection algorithms, feature extraction, GeoIP processing, integration tests, and pipeline operations.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily internal to the testing framework. However, developers can indirectly interact with it by running tests or using fixtures defined in `conftest.py`.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to test backend functionalities of the AI Threat Detection system. Running these tests ensures that new features and changes do not break existing functionality.

This package is crucial for maintaining high standards of quality and reliability in the backend components of the project.
