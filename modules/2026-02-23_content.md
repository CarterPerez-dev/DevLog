## Module Overview

### backend/api/admin/models/content

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package is part of the `CertGames-Core` repository, specifically focusing on models related to content management within the admin interface. The primary purpose is to define domain-specific models that encapsulate data for daily metrics.

**File Relationships:**
- **DailyMetrics.py**: Contains the implementation of a model class designed to handle and store daily performance or activity metrics.
- **__init__.py**: Serves as an entry point, exporting `DailyMetrics` for external use. It ensures that only the intended public API is exposed.

**Public API Surface:**
The package exposes a single class, `DailyMetrics`, which can be imported via:
```python
from backend.api.admin.models.content import DailyMetrics
```
This class provides methods and attributes to manage daily metrics data, including initialization with specific fields and operations for updating or retrieving metric values.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when they need to integrate or manipulate daily performance metrics within the admin section of the application. For instance, it can be used in views or background tasks that require processing or displaying daily activity reports.
