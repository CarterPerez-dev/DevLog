## Module Overview

# backend/qa/testing_qa/fixtures

## Purpose and Scope
The `fixtures` package in the `backend/qa/testing_qa` directory is designed to provide domain-specific test fixtures for quality assurance (QA) testing within the CertGames-Core repository. These fixtures include factory functions and predefined test data, enabling developers to create consistent and controlled test environments.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package, defining its namespace.
- **factories.py**: Contains factory functions that generate instances of domain models used in tests. These factories help in creating complex objects with predefined attributes quickly and consistently.
- **test_data.py**: Houses predefined test data, which can be used to initialize test cases or verify expected outcomes.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- Factory functions defined in `factories.py` for generating model instances.
- Predefined test data in `test_data.py`.

Example usage of the public API:

```python
from backend.qa.testing_qa.fixtures.factories import create_user
from backend.qa.testing_qa.fixtures.test_data import sample_user_data

# Using a factory to generate a user instance
user = create_user(**sample_user_data)
```

## When Developers Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when setting up test environments, creating test data, and initializing test cases. The fixtures provide a standardized way to ensure that tests are consistent and reliable across different testing scenarios.
