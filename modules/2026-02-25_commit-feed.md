## Module Overview

# commit-feed Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `commit-feed` module in the `dashboard/frontend/src/components/commit-feed` directory is part of the CodeWorm repository, specifically designed for rendering a feed of recent commits within the application's user interface. This component focuses on displaying commit messages, authors, timestamps, and other relevant details to provide users with an overview of recent changes.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for the `commit-feed` module. It exports the main component (`CommitFeed`) defined in `commit-feed.tsx`.
- **commit-feed.tsx**: Contains the React functional component responsible for rendering commit information. This file includes the logic and UI for displaying commits.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface of this module is exposed through the `index.ts` file, which exports a single component:
```typescript
export { CommitFeed } from './commit-feed';
```
Developers can import and use the `CommitFeed` component to integrate commit feed functionality into their applications.

## When to Use This Module
This module should be used by developers who need to display a list of recent commits in their application. It is particularly useful for dashboards, change logs, or any section where users require an overview of recent code changes. By leveraging this component, developers can ensure a consistent and efficient way to present commit information across the application.
