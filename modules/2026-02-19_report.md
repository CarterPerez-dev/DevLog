## Module Overview

### Report Module Documentation

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `app/report` package is part of the backend for a bug bounty platform. It handles the creation, management, and interaction with reports submitted by security researchers during bug bounties.

**File Relationships:**
- **Report.py:** Contains the core `Report` class and its associated methods.
- **Attachment.py:** Manages file attachments related to reports.
- **Comment.py:** Handles comments on reports, including creating, updating, and deleting them.
- **dependencies.py:** Imports necessary dependencies for the package.
- **repository.py:** Implements database operations using SQLAlchemy for report-related entities.
- **routes.py:** Defines RESTful API routes for interacting with reports via HTTP requests.
- **schemas.py:** Contains Pydantic schemas for validating data structures of reports and their attachments.
- **service.py:** Provides business logic services for handling complex operations on reports.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- `Report` class methods for creating, updating, and deleting reports.
- `Attachment` management functions.
- `Comment` creation and deletion endpoints via RESTful routes.
- Validation schemas for ensuring data integrity.
- Business logic services for advanced report operations.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending features related to bug bounty reporting. Specifically, developers working on the backend API will use `routes.py` and `service.py`, while those handling database interactions will leverage `repository.py`.
