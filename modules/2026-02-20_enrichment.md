## Module Overview

### Module Documentation: `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/core/enrichment`

#### Purpose and Scope
The `enrichment` package is part of the backend application for an AI-driven threat detection system. Its primary role is to enhance raw data with additional context, particularly focusing on geographical information.

#### File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`:** This file serves as the entry point for the `enrichment` module and contains any necessary initialization code.
- **`geoip.py`:** Contains functionality related to geolocation enrichment using GeoIP databases. It provides methods to resolve IP addresses into geographical information.

#### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Functions from `geoip.py` such as `resolve_ip`, which takes an IP address and returns its geographical details.
- Any additional utility functions or classes defined in `__init__.py`.

#### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to enrich raw threat data with geolocation information. For example, after detecting suspicious network activity, the system may call methods from `geoip.py` to determine the location of an IP address involved in the activity.

This setup ensures that critical threat intelligence is enriched with geographical context, enhancing the overall effectiveness and usability of the AI-driven threat detection system.
