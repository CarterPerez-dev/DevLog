## Module Overview

# backend/workers

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/workers` package contains background workers designed for batch processing tasks. This package is part of the `vuemantics` repository, focusing on handling large-scale data processing in an asynchronous manner.

## File Structure and Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `workers` package, providing a namespace for its submodules.
- **batch_processor.py**: Contains the core functionality for batch processing tasks. It is imported by `__init__.py`, making it accessible to other parts of the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Classes and functions defined in `batch_processor.py` that handle batch processing logic, such as `BatchProcessor`.
- Type hints and docstrings are used throughout for clarity and maintainability.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or utilize background workers for batch processing tasks. For example, setting up periodic data imports or handling large-scale computations in the background without blocking the main application flow.
