## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/testing

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/admin/models/testing` package is designed to provide models specifically for testing purposes within the administrative interface of the CertGames-Core application. This package encapsulates test-related data structures, ensuring that they are isolated from other parts of the application.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point and exports `TestingMetrics` as part of the public API.
- **TestingMetrics.py**: Contains the implementation details for testing metrics models. This file defines classes and methods related to test metrics, which are used in administrative tasks such as performance monitoring or debugging.

## Public API Surface
The package exposes a single class: `TestingMetrics`. The `__all__` list in the `__init__.py` ensures that this class is readily accessible when importing from the package. Developers can use it to interact with test metrics directly, facilitating administrative tasks and data analysis.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module during development and testing phases of CertGames-Core. Specifically, administrators or developers responsible for monitoring application performance or debugging issues would utilize these models to gather and analyze test-related data.
