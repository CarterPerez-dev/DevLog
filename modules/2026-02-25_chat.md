## Module Overview

# backend/app/chat

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/chat` package is designed to handle chat-related functionalities in the application, including routing, schema validation, and service logic.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package by importing the router. It also specifies that only the `router` object should be publicly accessible.
- **router.py**: Contains the API endpoints for handling chat-related requests.
- **schemas.py**: Defines Pydantic schemas to validate and serialize chat data, ensuring consistency in data structures.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic for chat operations such as message processing, user interactions, etc.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface of this package is primarily the `router` object imported from `__init__.py`. Developers can interact with it to define and manage chat-related routes within their application.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to integrate chat functionalities into their backend application. By importing and configuring the `router`, developers can easily set up endpoints for handling chat messages, user interactions, and other related operations. The schemas ensure that data is processed correctly, while the service layer handles complex business logic.
