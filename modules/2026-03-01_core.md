## Module Overview

# codeworm/core

## Purpose and Scope
The `codeworm/core` package provides foundational components for managing settings, logging, state, and event publishing in the CodeWorm application. It ensures that core functionalities are modular and easily accessible.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for importing all public classes and functions from sub-modules.
- **config.py**: Handles configuration settings such as `AnalyzerSettings`, `CodeWormSettings`, etc., providing a centralized way to manage application configurations.
- **events.py**: Manages event publishing, facilitating communication between different parts of the application.
- **logging.py**: Configures logging mechanisms using `get_logger` and `configure_logging`.
- **notifier.py**: Not mentioned in the provided files but implied for notifications or alerts.
- **state.py**: Manages application state with `StateManager`.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes like `AnalyzerSettings`, `CodeWormSettings`, etc., functions such as `get_enabled_repos` and `configure_logging`, and objects like `EventPublisher` and `StateManager`. These are exposed via the `__all__` list in `__init__.py`.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this package when setting up application configurations, managing logging, handling state transitions, or publishing events. It is essential for initializing and configuring the core functionalities of CodeWorm.
