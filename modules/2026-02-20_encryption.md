## Module Overview

# encryption

## Purpose and Scope
The `encryption` package in the `advanced/encrypted-p2p-chat/backend/app/core` directory is designed to handle cryptographic operations for a peer-to-peer chat application, ensuring secure communication between users.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package. It imports and initializes the core encryption functionalities provided by `double_ratchet.py` and `x3dh_manager.py`.
  
- **double_ratchet.py**: Implements the Double Ratchet Algorithm, a cryptographic protocol that ensures forward secrecy in real-time communications.

- **x3dh_manager.py**: Manages the eXtended Triple Diffie-Hellman (X3DH) key agreement mechanism, which is crucial for establishing secure sessions between peers.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `DoubleRatchet` class from `double_ratchet.py`: Provides methods to initialize and manage the Double Ratchet state.
- `X3dhManager` class from `x3dh_manager.py`: Offers functions to handle key exchanges and session management using X3DH.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or testing cryptographic functionalities in the backend of the peer-to-peer chat application. Specifically, they would use the `DoubleRatchet` class for secure message encryption/decryption and the `X3dhManager` for setting up initial secure sessions between users.
