## Module Overview

# frontends/react-native-ios/src/api/hooks

## Purpose and Scope
This package provides custom React Native hooks for authentication and user management, specifically tailored for iOS applications within the `fullstack-template` repository.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, re-exporting the functionality provided by `useAuth` and `useUsers`.
- **useAuth.ts**: Contains logic for handling authentication-related tasks such as login, logout, and token management.
- **useUsers.ts**: Implements hooks for fetching and managing user data, including CRUD operations.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `useAuth`: Custom hook for managing authentication states and actions.
- `useUsers`: Custom hook for interacting with user-related APIs.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or utilize custom hooks in their React Native components, particularly focusing on authentication and user management. By leveraging these hooks, developers can ensure consistent and secure handling of user data across the application.
