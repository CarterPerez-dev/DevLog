## Module Overview

# Stacks/Go-React/Frontend/src/api/hooks

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains custom React hooks for handling various aspects of user interaction with the application, such as authentication, administrative tasks, and managing users.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all other hooks.
- **useAdmin.ts**: Provides functions for performing admin-specific operations.
- **useAuth.ts**: Handles authentication-related logic, including login, logout, and token management.
- **useUsers.ts**: Manages user data retrieval and manipulation.

## Public API Surface
The public API consists of three main hooks:
1. `useAdmin`: Exposes administrative functionalities.
2. `useAuth`: Offers methods for managing the authenticated state.
3. `useUsers`: Provides utilities for interacting with user data.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or utilize custom React hooks in their components. For example, a component that requires admin permissions would import and use `useAdmin`, while a login form might leverage `useAuth` for handling authentication states. Similarly, user-related operations such as fetching or updating profiles can be handled using `useUsers`.
