## Module Overview

# frontends/react-scss/src/api/hooks Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontends/react-scss/src/api/hooks` module provides reusable React hooks for managing state and side effects in the frontend application, specifically focusing on authentication, user management, and administrative actions.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an export hub, re-exporting all public hooks from other files.
- **useAdmin.ts**: Contains logic related to admin-specific operations, such as fetching admin data or managing admin-related state.
- **useAuth.ts**: Manages authentication-related hooks, including login, logout, and token handling.
- **useUsers.ts**: Provides hooks for user management, such as fetching users, creating new users, and updating user information.

## Public API Surface
Developers can access the following public hooks through `index.ts`:
- `useAdmin()`: Hook for admin-specific operations.
- `useAuth()`: Authentication-related hooks.
- `useUsers()`: User management hooks.

## When to Use This Module
This module is essential for developers working on components that require authentication, user data manipulation, or admin functionalities. By leveraging these hooks, developers can ensure consistent and efficient state management across the application.
