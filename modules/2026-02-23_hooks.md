## Module Overview

# Stacks/FastAPI-React/frontend/src/api/hooks

## Purpose and Scope
This package provides custom React hooks for managing interactions with backend APIs in a FastAPI-React application, specifically focusing on authentication, user management, and administrative actions.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all other hooks.
- **useAdmin.ts**: Contains logic for handling admin-specific API calls.
- **useAuth.ts**: Manages authentication-related operations such as login, logout, and token management.
- **useUsers.ts**: Implements hooks for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting user data.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `useAdmin`: Exposes functions for admin tasks.
- `useAuth`: Provides methods for managing user authentication states and actions.
- `useUsers`: Offers functionalities to interact with the users' data in the backend.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or integrate custom React hooks that handle API interactions, particularly related to authentication and user management. This ensures consistent and secure handling of API calls throughout the application.
