## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `api/types`

## Purpose and Scope

The `api/types` module in the `stacks/go-react/frontend/src/api/types` directory is designed to define TypeScript types for API interactions, specifically focusing on authentication and user-related data structures. This ensures consistent type definitions across the application.

## File Relationships

- **auth.types.ts**: Contains types related to authentication processes such as tokens, login responses, and registration details.
- **user.types.ts**: Defines types for user entities including profiles, roles, and permissions.
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, re-exporting all types from `auth.types` and `user.types`, providing a single import location.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
```typescript
export * from './auth.types';
export * from './user.types';
```

This allows developers to easily access all defined types without needing to import multiple files.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when working on components or services that handle user authentication and manage user data. By importing the necessary types, they can ensure type safety and consistency in their code.
