## Module Overview

# frontends/react-scss/src/api/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontends/react-scss/src/api/types` module provides TypeScript type definitions for the application's API, specifically focusing on authentication and user-related data structures used in React components. This ensures type safety and consistency across the frontend codebase.

## File Relationships
- **auth.types.ts**: Defines types related to authentication, such as tokens, login credentials, and session states.
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point for importing all types defined within this module.
- **user.types.ts**: Contains types for user-related data, including user profiles, roles, and permissions.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes re-exported types from `auth.types` and `user.types`. Developers can import these types directly using the `index.ts` file:
```typescript
import { AuthType, UserType } from 'frontends/react-scss/src/api/types';
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when working on components that require authentication or user-related data. For instance, when implementing login forms, user profiles, or handling session states in React components.

This modular structure ensures that type definitions are centralized and easily accessible throughout the frontend codebase.
