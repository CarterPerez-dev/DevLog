## Module Overview

# tests/unit

## Purpose and Scope

The `tests/unit` package is part of the `stripe-referral` project, dedicated to unit testing core functionalities. This package contains isolated test cases that verify individual components or methods without external dependencies.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as an initialization script for the package. It can be used to define common fixtures, setup and teardown functions, or any other shared utilities needed by the tests.
  
- **test_repositories.py**: This is the primary test module that contains unit tests for repository classes or methods within the `stripe-referral` project. These tests ensure that each component behaves as expected in controlled environments.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface of this package is limited to the test functions defined within `test_repositories.py`. Developers can interact with these tests by running them using a testing framework like pytest or unittest.

### Example Usage
```python
# Running individual tests
pytest tests/unit/test_repositories.py::test_create_referral

# Running all unit tests in the package
pytest tests/unit/
```

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module during development and continuous integration processes. It is crucial for ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality by providing a suite of isolated, repeatable tests.

By maintaining comprehensive unit tests, developers can confidently refactor code or add new features without introducing bugs.
