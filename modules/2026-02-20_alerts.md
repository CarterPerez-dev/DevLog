## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `app/core/alerts`

## Purpose and Scope

The `app/core/alerts` package is part of the backend module in the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection` project. It focuses on managing alert mechanisms within the application, ensuring that relevant security threats are promptly detected and communicated.

## File Relationships

- **`__init__.py`:** This file serves as the entry point for the package. It defines the constant `ALERTS_CHANNEL`, which is used to identify the channel through which alerts will be dispatched.
  
- **`dispatcher.py`:** Contains the logic for dispatching alerts based on detected threats. It interacts with other modules and services to ensure that appropriate actions are taken when an alert is triggered.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface of this package includes:
- `ALERTS_CHANNEL`: A string constant used to identify the channel for alert communication.
- Functions and classes defined in `dispatcher.py` for dispatching alerts, which may include methods like `dispatch_alert`, `process_threat`, etc.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this package when implementing or integrating new threat detection mechanisms. Specifically:
- **Threat Detection Integration:** To ensure that newly detected threats are correctly identified and communicated through the defined alert channels.
- **Alert Handling:** For customizing how alerts are processed and dispatched, by interacting with functions in `dispatcher.py`.

This module provides a clear interface for managing alert communications within the application, making it easier to integrate new threat detection logic.
