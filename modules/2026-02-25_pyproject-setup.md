## Module Overview

# src/pyproject_setup

## Purpose and Scope
The `src/pyproject_setup` package is designed to handle setup configurations for Python projects, particularly focusing on customizing `pyproject.toml` files. It provides tools for generating configuration snippets, applying predefined presets, and managing command-line interfaces.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **cli.py**: Contains functions and classes related to command-line interface (CLI) operations, such as parsing arguments and executing setup tasks.
- **generator.py**: Implements logic for generating configuration snippets based on user inputs or predefined templates.
- **presets.py**: Houses predefined configurations that can be applied to `pyproject.toml` files, offering a quick way to set up common project structures.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Functions and classes in `cli.py` for interacting with the CLI.
- Classes and functions in `generator.py` for generating configuration snippets.
- Preset configurations defined in `presets.py`.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to customize their project's setup, especially when working with `pyproject.toml`. It is particularly useful during initial project setup or when modifying existing projects. Developers can leverage the CLI for quick setup tasks and utilize the generator and presets for more complex configuration needs.
