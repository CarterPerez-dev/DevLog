## Module Overview

# codeworm/analysis Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `codeworm/analysis` package is designed for analyzing code repositories, focusing on identifying and evaluating potential areas of improvement in terms of complexity, documentation, and interest score.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point, importing and exporting all public classes and functions.
- **analyzer.py**: Contains core analysis logic, including `CodeAnalyzer` for overall repository analysis and `analyze_repository`.
- **complexity.py**: Implements complexity analysis with `ComplexityAnalyzer`, `FileComplexity`, and related metrics.
- **parser.py**: Provides tools like `ParserManager` and `ParsedClass` for parsing code into manageable components.
- **scanner.py**: Manages scanning of repositories using `RepoScanner` and `ScannedFile`.
- **scoring.py**: Evaluates repository interest with `InterestScore` and `InterestScorer`, incorporating metrics from `GitStats`.
- **targets.py**: Defines targets such as `DocumentationTarget` for specific analysis tasks.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes like `CodeAnalyzer`, `ComplexityAnalyzer`, `ParserManager`, and functions such as `analyze_repository`. These provide a comprehensive interface for analyzing code repositories.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this package when they need to perform detailed analyses of their codebases, including identifying complex areas, assessing documentation quality, and determining the overall interest score based on repository activity.
