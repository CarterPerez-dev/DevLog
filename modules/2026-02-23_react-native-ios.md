## Module Overview

# frontends/react-native-ios Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontends/react-native-ios` module is part of the fullstack-template repository, specifically tailored for iOS development using React Native. Its primary purpose is to set up and register the root component of the application.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for the React Native application. It imports and registers the main `App` component.
- **App.tsx**: Contains the main application logic and UI components, structured using Tamagui for styling and layout.
- **tamagui.config.ts**: Configures Tamagui settings, such as theme, styles, and other configurations specific to the project.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is minimal. The `index.ts` file exports nothing directly but registers the root component via `registerRootComponent`. Developers do not interact with this module's internal components directly; instead, they rely on it to bootstrap the application.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when setting up or modifying the React Native iOS frontend of their project. It is essential for ensuring that the app runs correctly both in native builds and Expo Go environments. Developers can customize `App.tsx` for specific application logic and styles, while `tamagui.config.ts` allows them to configure the UI framework according to their needs.
