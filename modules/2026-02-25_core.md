## Module Overview

# backend/app/core

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/core` package serves as a foundational layer for the application, providing essential components such as schemas and exception handling. This package is designed to be imported by other modules within the project to ensure consistent data structures and error handling practices.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and exposes the `AppInfoResponse` schema class.
- **exceptions.py**: Contains custom exceptions used throughout the application for robust error management.
- **schemas.py**: Defines Pydantic schemas that are used to validate and serialize data, ensuring consistency in data handling across different parts of the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `AppInfoResponse` (from `schemas.py`): A schema class used to represent application information responses.
- The package imports `AppInfoResponse` from `schemas.py`, making it available for use by other modules.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to define or validate data structures, particularly in API responses. For example, when creating an endpoint that returns application information, the `AppInfoResponse` schema can be used to ensure the response is correctly formatted and validated. Additionally, developers might import exceptions from `exceptions.py` for handling errors consistently across the application.

This package acts as a central hub for defining common data structures and error handling mechanisms, promoting code consistency and maintainability throughout the project.
