## Module Overview

## codeworm/core Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `codeworm/core` package provides foundational components for managing settings, logging, state, and event publishing in the CodeWorm application. It ensures that core functionalities are modular and easily accessible.

### File Relationships
- **config.py**: Contains classes and functions for handling various settings like `AnalyzerSettings`, `CodeWormSettings`, etc.
- **events.py**: Implements an `EventPublisher` class to manage event-based communication within the application.
- **logging.py**: Offers logging utilities with a `configure_logging` function and a `get_logger` method.
- **state.py**: Manages application state through a `StateManager` class.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes classes like `AnalyzerSettings`, `CodeWormSettings`, `EventPublisher`, and `StateManager`. Functions such as `get_enabled_repos`, `get_settings`, `init_publisher`, and `configure_logging` are exposed for configuration and management tasks. Developers can interact with these to set up the application's core functionalities.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when setting up or configuring CodeWorm, particularly during initial setup or when needing to manage settings, logging, state, and event handling throughout the application lifecycle.
