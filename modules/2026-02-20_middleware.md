## Module Overview

## Middleware Module Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `middleware` package in the `backend/app` directory is designed to provide a layer of abstraction for handling request correlation within the Bug Bounty Platform backend application. This ensures that each request can be uniquely identified, facilitating easier debugging and logging.

### File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`:** Serves as the entry point for the package, importing and exposing `CorrelationIdMiddleware`.
- **`correlation.py`:** Contains the implementation of the `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, which is responsible for generating and managing unique correlation IDs for requests.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
```python
from .correlation import CorrelationIdMiddleware

class CorrelationIdMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response
    
    # Other methods and properties
```
This class is the primary export of the package, allowing developers to integrate request correlation into their middleware stack.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to ensure that each API call or HTTP request within the Bug Bounty Platform backend can be uniquely identified. By integrating `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, developers can track and correlate logs across multiple requests, making it easier to diagnose issues and trace user interactions.

This middleware is particularly useful in complex microservices architectures where requests might traverse multiple services before being processed.
