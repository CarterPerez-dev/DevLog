## Module Overview

# tests

## Purpose and Scope
The `tests` package in the `stripe-referral` repository is dedicated to housing all test-related code, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage for various components of the application.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the initialization script for the `tests` package. It can contain any necessary setup or configuration required for tests.
- **conftest.py**: This file contains fixtures and other test-related configurations that are shared across multiple test modules within this package. Fixtures defined here can be used to set up common test environments, ensuring consistency in testing.

## Public API Surface
The `tests` package itself does not expose any public APIs directly for external use. Instead, it provides a structured environment for running tests and managing test fixtures.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with the `tests` module when they need to write or run tests for the `stripe-referral` application. By organizing tests in this package, developers can easily locate and manage test cases, ensuring that critical functionalities are thoroughly tested before deployment. Fixtures defined in `conftest.py` help maintain a consistent testing environment across different test scenarios.
