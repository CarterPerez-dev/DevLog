## Module Overview

## Documentation for `fastapi/app/auth`

### Purpose and Scope

The `auth` package is part of the `ios-test` repository, focusing on authentication mechanisms within the FastAPI application. It encapsulates all aspects related to user authentication, including token management, dependency injection, database interactions, route handling, schema validation, and service logic.

### File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `auth` package, defining its public API surface.
- **RefreshToken.py**: Handles the creation, validation, and refreshing of access tokens.
- **dependencies.py**: Provides dependency injection mechanisms to ensure that authentication-related dependencies are easily accessible throughout the application.
- **repository.py**: Manages database interactions related to user authentication, such as token storage and retrieval.
- **routes.py**: Defines API routes for handling authentication requests, including login, logout, and token refresh endpoints.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas used for validating request bodies and responses in the `auth` module.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic related to user authentication, such as token validation and user session management.

### Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
- Token-related functions from `RefreshToken.py`.
- Dependency injection mechanisms defined in `dependencies.py`.
- Authentication routes exposed by `routes.py`.
- Schemas for request/response validation found in `schemas.py`.
- Business logic encapsulated within the `service.py` module.

### When to Use

Developers would interact with this package when setting up authentication endpoints, managing user sessions, or validating tokens. It is particularly useful during the development and testing phases of a FastAPI application where robust authentication mechanisms are required.
