## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/security/auth

## Purpose and Scope

The `auth` package in the `CarterOS-Server/src/core/security` directory is designed to handle authentication mechanisms for the server, primarily focusing on JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. This package ensures secure user sessions and access control.

## File Relationships

1. **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package, importing necessary components from other files.
2. **dependencies.py**: Contains utility functions and classes that are shared across different modules within this package. It defines common dependencies required by `jwt.py`.
3. **jwt.py**: Implements JWT-based authentication logic, including token generation, validation, and handling.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
- Token-related functions for generating, validating, and managing JWTs.
- Utility functions from `dependencies.py` that support the core authentication processes.

```python
from .jwt import generate_token, validate_token
```

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending user authentication in the server. Specifically, they can use the token-related functions to secure API endpoints and manage user sessions. The utility functions from `dependencies.py` provide additional support for handling common tasks related to JWTs.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the authentication mechanisms in the CarterOS-Server project.
