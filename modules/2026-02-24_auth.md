## Module Overview

# backend/auth

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/auth` package provides JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication mechanisms for the application, including token creation, decoding, and user verification. It also includes a dependency function to ensure that uploaded files are owned by the authenticated user.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point of the `auth` module, importing and exporting all necessary functions and classes.
- **jwt_auth.py**: Contains JWT token-related functionalities such as creating access tokens, refresh tokens, decoding tokens, and retrieving current users.
- **dependencies.py**: Houses a dependency function to verify that uploaded files belong to the authenticated user.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Token creation functions: `create_token_pair`, `create_access_token`, `create_refresh_token`.
- Token decoding: `decode_token`.
- User retrieval: `get_current_user`, `get_current_active_user`.
- Token refreshing: `refresh_access_token`.
- Dependency function: `verify_upload_ownership`.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when implementing authentication and authorization in the backend. Specifically, it is used for generating JWT tokens during user login or token refresh, decoding tokens to retrieve user information, and ensuring that uploaded files are owned by the authenticated user.
