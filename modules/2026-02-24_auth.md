## Module Overview

# v1/backend/app/auth

## Purpose and Scope
The `v1/backend/app/auth` package is part of the authentication domain in the `my-portfolio` project. It encapsulates all logic related to user authentication, including token management, repository interactions, route handling, and schema validation.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **dependencies.py**: Manages dependencies required for the module.
- **repository.py**: Contains database operations for authentication-related entities.
- **routes.py**: Defines API routes and their corresponding handlers.
- **schemas.py**: Houses Pydantic schemas for validation of request and response data.
- **service.py**: Implements core business logic, such as token refresh and user authentication.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `RefreshToken`: A class in `RefreshToken.py` that handles the generation and validation of refresh tokens.
- Authentication-related routes defined in `routes.py`.
- Schemas for request and response data in `schemas.py`.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending authentication features, such as setting up API endpoints, handling token validation, or managing user sessions. The public API provides a clean interface for integrating authentication services into the application.
