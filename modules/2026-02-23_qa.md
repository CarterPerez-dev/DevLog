## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/qa

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/admin/models/qa` package is designed for unit testing of admin models within the CertGames-Core application. It ensures that the data structures used by administrative functionalities are correctly implemented.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the QA module, providing a namespace and potentially importing key classes or functions.
- **conftest.py**: Contains configuration settings and fixtures specific to testing admin models. It sets up test environments and provides reusable setup code across multiple tests.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is minimal, primarily consisting of any classes or functions imported from `__init__.py`. These are typically used by developers responsible for writing unit tests for the administrative model components.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers working on the CertGames-Core backend who need to ensure that admin models function correctly would use this package. Specifically, they would write and run unit tests using fixtures and configurations defined in `conftest.py` to validate the behavior of these models under various scenarios.
