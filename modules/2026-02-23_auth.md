## Module Overview

### Documentation for `backends/fastapi/app/auth`

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `auth` package in the `backends/fastapi/app` directory is part of the authentication domain, responsible for managing user authentication processes within the application. It includes components such as token management, repository interactions, route definitions, and service logic.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the package, defining its public API.
- **dependencies.py**: Contains dependency injection configurations and utility functions used across the module.
- **repository.py**: Implements database operations related to authentication, such as user validation and token storage.
- **routes.py**: Defines FastAPI routes for handling authentication-related HTTP requests.
- **schemas.py**: Houses Pydantic schemas for validating request and response data.
- **service.py**: Contains business logic for authenticating users, generating tokens, and managing session states.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- Authentication route definitions in `routes.py`.
- Token management functions in `service.py` (e.g., `generate_token`, `verify_token`).
- Dependency injection configurations in `dependencies.py`.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when setting up and managing user authentication within the FastAPI application. It is particularly useful for integrating custom authentication flows, handling token refreshes via `RefreshToken.py`, and ensuring secure communication between clients and the backend.

This structure allows for modular and maintainable code, making it easier to extend or modify specific aspects of the authentication system as needed.
