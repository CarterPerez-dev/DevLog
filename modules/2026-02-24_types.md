## Module Overview

# red-recon/src/api/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `red-recon/src/api/types` module in the `ios-test` repository is designed to encapsulate all type definitions used throughout the application, particularly for API interactions. This ensures consistency and clarity in data structures across various components.

## File Relationships

- **auth.types.ts**: Defines types related to authentication.
- **user.types.ts**: Contains user-related types.
- **partner.types.ts**: Includes partner-specific types.
- **periodLog.types.ts** and **dailyLog.types.ts**: Define types for log entries, with `periodLog` covering longer durations and `dailyLog` focusing on daily activities.
- **cycle.types.ts**: Provides types related to cycles or phases within the application.
- **notification.types.ts**: Contains types for notifications.
- **achievement.types.ts**: Defines types associated with achievements.

All files are aggregated in `index.ts`, which exports all defined types, making them easily accessible throughout the project.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes a wide range of type definitions such as interfaces, enums, and utility types. These types cover various aspects like authentication, user data, partner interactions, logging, notifications, cycles, and achievements.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to define or utilize specific types for API requests, responses, or internal data structures within the application. It is particularly useful during development phases where type safety and consistency are crucial.
