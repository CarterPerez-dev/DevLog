## Module Overview

# frontend/src/api/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `frontend/src/api/types` module in the vuemantics repository provides TypeScript type definitions for various APIs used throughout the application, ensuring consistent and type-safe interactions with different services.

## File Relationships

- **auth.types.ts**: Defines types related to authentication processes.
- **bulk-upload.types.ts**: Contains types specific to bulk file upload operations.
- **client-config.types.ts**: Includes types for configuring client settings.
- **search.types.ts**: Provides types for search-related operations and data structures.
- **upload.types.ts**: Offers types for general file uploads.

`index.ts` acts as an entry point, exporting all types from the individual files to simplify import statements in other parts of the application.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes a wide range of type definitions such as interfaces, enums, and utility types. These are exported via `index.ts`, making them accessible across different modules that require specific type information for their operations.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to define or validate data structures related to API interactions, particularly in contexts involving authentication, file uploads, client configuration, and search functionalities. By importing the relevant types from `frontend/src/api/types`, developers can ensure that their code adheres to the expected structure and type constraints defined by these APIs.
