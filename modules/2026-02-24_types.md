## Module Overview

# react-scss/src/api/types

## Purpose and Scope

This package defines TypeScript type definitions for various components of the `react-scss` library, ensuring type safety and consistency across different parts of the application.

## File Relationships

- **common.types.ts**: Contains common types used throughout the package.
- **metrics.types.ts**: Defines types related to metrics or performance data.
- **backups.types.ts**: Includes types for handling backups or storage operations.
- **collections.types.ts**: Provides types specific to collections, such as arrays or objects.

`index.ts` acts as an entry point, exporting all types from the other files. This centralizes type imports and ensures a clean API surface.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes all exported types from `common.types`, `metrics.types`, `backups.types`, and `collections.types`. Developers can import these types directly using:

```typescript
import { BackupType, MetricType } from 'react-scss/src/api/types';
```

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need type definitions for their components or when integrating new features that require specific data structures. This package is essential for maintaining strong typing and reducing errors in the development process.
