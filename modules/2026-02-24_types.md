## Module Overview

# v1/frontend/src/api/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains TypeScript type definitions for various APIs used in the frontend of `my-portfolio`. It ensures consistency and clarity in data handling across different components, particularly focusing on user authentication, blog posts, certifications, experiences, projects, search functionalities, and more.

## File Relationships
Each file within this module defines specific types related to its domain. For instance:
- **auth.types.ts**: Contains types for authentication-related operations.
- **blog.types.ts**: Defines types for blog post data structures.
- **common.types.ts**: Includes generic utility types used across multiple files.
- **experience.types.ts** and **project.types.ts**: Define types for work experience and project details, respectively.

## Public API Surface
The `index.ts` file exports all types defined in the individual type definition files. This allows developers to import a wide range of types from a single point, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

```typescript
import { AuthType, BlogPostType, CertificationType } from 'v1/frontend/src/api/types';
```

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when they need to define or work with specific data structures in their components. For example, a developer working on the user authentication feature would import `AuthType` from here.

This organization ensures that all frontend developers have access to consistent and well-defined types, promoting robust and maintainable code practices.
