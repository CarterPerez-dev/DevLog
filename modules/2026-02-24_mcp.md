## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/integrations/mcp

## Purpose and Scope
The `mcp` package in the `CarterOS-Server/src/core/integrations` directory is designed to facilitate integration with the Minecraft Command Processor (MCP) for server management tasks. This package provides a structured interface to interact with MCP, enabling operations such as command execution, status checks, and configuration management.

## File Relationships
The package contains two files:
1. **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the `mcp` module. It imports the primary functionality from `server.py` and exports it via the `__all__` list.
2. **server.py**: Contains the core logic for interacting with MCP, including functions to execute commands, retrieve server status, and manage configurations.

## Public API Surface
The public API is exposed through the `mcp` object imported from `__init__.py`. This includes methods like:
- `execute_command(command)`: Runs a command on the Minecraft server.
- `get_server_status()`: Retrieves current server status information.
- `configure_minecraft(options)`: Applies configuration changes to the server.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this package when they need to programmatically manage a Minecraft server within the CarterOS environment. This could include automating routine tasks, integrating with other systems, or developing custom server management tools.
