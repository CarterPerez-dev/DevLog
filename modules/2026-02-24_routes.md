## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/routes

## Purpose and Scope

The `CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/routes` package is designed to handle authentication-related routes in the server application, ensuring secure user interactions with the system.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the module and imports essential components from other files.
- **auth.py**: Contains core authentication logic, including user login and logout functions. It serves as a central hub for managing authentication states.
- **admin.py**: Manages administrative-level routes and functionalities, providing access control and management features specific to administrators.
- **user.py**: Handles user-related routes and operations, such as registration, profile management, and personal data handling.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Functions in `auth.py` for login, logout, and session management.
- Routes defined in both `admin.py` and `user.py`, which are exposed via the Flask application blueprint.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending authentication features. Specifically, they can:
- Implement custom authentication logic by modifying functions in `auth.py`.
- Add new routes for user management by extending classes and functions in `user.py` and `admin.py`.
