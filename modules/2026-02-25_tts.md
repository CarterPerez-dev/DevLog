## Module Overview

# backend/app/tts

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/tts` package is part of the text-to-speech (TTS) functionality in the `angelamos-3d` repository. It handles the routing, schema validation, and core service logic for TTS requests.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package by importing the router module.
- **router.py**: Manages HTTP routes and endpoints for TTS requests, ensuring they are properly handled and directed to the appropriate services.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for validating input data structures used in TTS requests.
- **service.py**: Implements the core logic for text-to-speech conversion, including any necessary dependencies or third-party integrations.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is exposed through the `__all__` list in `__init__.py`, which includes only the `router`. Developers would interact with this package by using the router to handle TTS requests. The router provides a clean interface for integrating TTS functionality into the application's HTTP endpoints.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or extend text-to-speech capabilities in their application. By leveraging the router, developers can define and manage TTS-related routes efficiently, ensuring that all requests are properly validated and processed by the appropriate services.
