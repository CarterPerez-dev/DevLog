## Module Overview

# backend/app

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app` package serves as the core application layer of the repository, handling configuration settings and main application logic.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package and sets up any necessary configurations or imports.
- **config.py**: Manages application-specific configurations, including environment variables and settings.
- **main.py**: Contains the primary entry point for the application, where initialization and execution of core functionalities occur.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- Configuration management via `config.py`.
- Application entry points defined in `main.py`.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package during application setup and configuration. Specifically, when initializing the application or accessing its configurations, they should reference both `config.py` and `main.py`. The `__init__.py` file ensures that these components are properly loaded and available for use.

```python
# Example usage in main.py
from .config import settings

def start_application():
    print(f"Application started with config: {settings}")
```

This structure allows for modular, maintainable code where configuration and application logic are clearly separated.
