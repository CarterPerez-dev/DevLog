## Module Overview

### red-recon/src/shared/utils

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `red-recon/src/shared/utils` package is designed to provide utility functions that are shared across various parts of the application, particularly focusing on haptic feedback for user interactions.

**File Relationships:**
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for this module. It reexports all functionality from `haptics.ts`, making it easy for developers to import and use these utilities directly.
- **haptics.ts**: Contains specific functions related to haptic feedback, such as configuring and triggering haptic events.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- Functions for configuring haptic feedback settings
- Methods for triggering different types of haptic feedback

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this module in scenarios where they need to provide tactile feedback to users, such as when an action is successful or unsuccessful. For example, a developer might import and call `triggerSuccessFeedback()` from `haptics.ts` within a button click handler to give the user immediate visual and haptic confirmation of their action.

```typescript
import { triggerSuccessFeedback } from 'red-recon/src/shared/utils/haptics';

// Example usage in a component
const handleButtonClick = () => {
  // Perform some action
  triggerSuccessFeedback();
};
```

This structure ensures that utility functions are easily accessible and maintainable across the application.
