## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/analytics

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains models for analytics-related data, specifically designed for administrative purposes within the backend API of CertGames-Core. It includes various metrics and logs that help in monitoring and analyzing system performance and user interactions.

## File Relationships
- **DatabaseMetrics.py**: Models database-related metrics.
- **EndpointMetrics.py**: Tracks metrics related to API endpoints.
- **ErrorLog.py**: Manages logging of errors for easier debugging.
- **PerformanceMetric.py**: Measures overall application performance.
- **WebVital.py**: Focuses on web vitals, such as load times and user experience indicators.

`__init__.py` imports all the above modules, making them accessible via `backend.api.admin.models.analytics`.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes like `WebVital`, `ErrorLog`, `EndpointMetrics`, `DatabaseMetrics`, and `PerformanceMetric`. These classes are designed to be instantiated and used by developers for monitoring and logging purposes.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when they need to implement or extend analytics features in the backend API. For example, adding new performance metrics or integrating error logging mechanisms into their application.
