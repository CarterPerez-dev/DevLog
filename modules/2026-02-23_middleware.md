## Module Overview

## backends/fastapi/app/middleware

### Purpose and Scope
This package contains middleware components for FastAPI applications, specifically focusing on adding correlation IDs to manage traceability in distributed systems.

### File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`**: This file serves as the entry point for the `middleware` module. It imports and exports the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class.
- **`correlation.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, which is responsible for adding a unique correlation ID to requests.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `CorrelationIdMiddleware`: A middleware class that injects a correlation ID into FastAPI request contexts. This helps in tracking and correlating logs across different services.

### When to Use
Developers would use this module when building FastAPI applications that require distributed tracing or need to maintain consistent logging across multiple service calls. The `CorrelationIdMiddleware` can be easily integrated into the application's middleware stack to ensure every request has a unique identifier for traceability purposes.

```python
# Example of integrating CorrelationIdMiddleware in FastAPI app
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(CorrelationIdMiddleware)
```

This setup ensures that all requests processed by the FastAPI application will have a correlation ID, facilitating easier debugging and monitoring.
