## Module Overview

### admin Module

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `admin` module is part of the backend for a bug bounty platform, focusing on administrative functionalities such as user management, access control, and data manipulation.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the module by importing and exposing the `router`.
- **dependencies.py**: Contains utility functions and dependencies required by other components.
- **repository.py**: Implements database interactions using SQLAlchemy for CRUD operations on admin-related entities.
- **routes.py**: Defines API endpoints for administrative actions, leveraging the router exposed from `__init__.py`.
- **schemas.py**: Houses Pydantic schemas for validating data structures used in requests and responses.
- **service.py**: Contains business logic and service functions that interact with the repository to perform complex operations.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API is primarily accessed via the `router` object, which is exposed by the `__init__.py`. Developers can interact with this module through these endpoints to manage administrative tasks.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this module when implementing or extending backend functionalities related to administration. For example, adding new API endpoints for managing users or handling sensitive data operations.
