## Module Overview

# Services Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `app/services` package in the `encrypted-p2p-chat/backend` directory is responsible for providing core services that support the application's functionality, particularly focusing on authentication, messaging, prekey management, presence tracking, and WebSocket communication.

## File Relationships
- **auth_service.py**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **message_service.py**: Handles message creation, storage, and retrieval.
- **prekey_service.py**: Deals with prekey generation and management for secure key exchanges.
- **presence_service.py**: Tracks user presence status in real-time.
- **websocket_service.py**: Facilitates WebSocket communication between clients.

These services are interconnected to ensure a seamless and secure peer-to-peer chat experience. For instance, `AuthService` is used by other services to verify user identities before processing requests.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes like `AuthService`, `MessageService`, `PrekeyService`, `PresenceService`, and `WebSocketService`. Each class provides methods for interacting with the service's functionality. The `__init__.py` file exports these services as both objects and functions, allowing developers to easily import and use them.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending features related to user authentication, messaging, key management, presence tracking, and WebSocket communication in the application. For example, integrating real-time chat functionality or enhancing security measures by managing prekeys.
