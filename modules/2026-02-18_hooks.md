## Module Overview

# PROJECTS/advanced/bug-bounty-platform/frontend/src/api/hooks

## Purpose and Scope
This package provides reusable React hooks for the frontend of the Bug Bounty Platform, specifically designed to interact with backend APIs. The hooks are organized by functionality, ensuring that developers can easily access and utilize them based on their needs.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, exporting all individual hook files.
- **useAdmin.ts**, **useAuth.ts**, **usePrograms.ts**, **useReports.ts**, **useUsers.ts**: Each file contains a specific hook for handling different aspects of the application. For example, `useAuth` handles authentication logic, while `useUsers` manages user-related operations.

## Public API Surface
The public API consists of five hooks:
- `useAdmin`: Provides functionality related to administrative tasks.
- `useAuth`: Manages authentication and authorization processes.
- `usePrograms`: Handles interactions with bug bounty programs.
- `useReports`: Facilitates the creation, retrieval, and management of reports.
- `useUsers`: Manages user-related operations.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when building components that require API interactions. By importing specific hooks from this package, developers can efficiently manage authentication, user data, program details, report generation, and administrative tasks without duplicating code.
