## Module Overview

## Module Documentation: `frontend/src/api/hooks`

### Purpose and Scope

The `frontend/src/api/hooks` package provides reusable React hooks for managing authentication and video-related operations in the social-media-notes application. These hooks are designed to abstract away complex logic, making it easier for developers to interact with APIs and manage state.

### File Relationships

- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all public hooks defined in `useAuth` and `useVideos`.
- **useAuth.ts**: Contains custom React hooks for handling user authentication. This includes login, logout, and checking the current user's session.
- **useVideos.ts**: Provides hooks for fetching, uploading, and managing video content within the application.

### Public API Surface

The public API surface consists of two main hooks:
1. `useAuth`: Exposes methods for authenticating users, including login and logout functionalities.
2. `useVideos`: Offers functions to interact with video data, such as fetching videos and handling uploads.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would use this module when they need to implement features related to user authentication or video management in their components. By leveraging these hooks, developers can focus on component logic rather than repetitive API calls and state management.
