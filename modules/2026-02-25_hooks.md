## Module Overview

# frontend/src/hooks Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/hooks` module provides reusable React hooks for managing complex state and side effects in the application, specifically focusing on integrating 3D scenes and voice recognition functionalities.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all other hooks.
- **useThreeScene.ts**: Manages interactions with a 3D scene, providing functions to update and render objects within it.
- **useVoicePipeline.ts**: Handles the setup and management of a voice recognition pipeline, enabling speech-to-text conversion.
- **useWakeWord.ts**: Implements logic for detecting wake words, which can trigger specific actions in the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `useThreeScene`: Exposes methods to manipulate 3D scene elements.
- `useVoicePipeline`: Provides functions to initialize and control voice recognition processes.
- `useWakeWord`: Offers hooks for detecting wake words, facilitating user interaction triggers.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to integrate real-time 3D rendering or voice recognition functionalities into their React components. By leveraging these hooks, developers can manage complex state and side effects more efficiently without duplicating code across different parts of the application.
