## Module Overview

# red-recon/src/features/calendar/hooks

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains hooks specifically designed for handling date-related operations within the calendar feature of the `red-recon` application. The primary focus is on providing reusable logic to manage periods associated with dates.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all functionalities provided by the package.
- **usePeriodForDate.ts**: Contains a custom hook that calculates and returns the period (e.g., "this week", "next month") for a given date. This hook is essential for dynamically determining relevant time periods in calendar views.

## Public API Surface
The public API consists of:
- `usePeriodForDate`: A TypeScript hook that accepts a date as input and returns the appropriate period string based on the current context.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when they need to display or filter calendar data based on periods. For instance, when implementing a feature that requires showing events for "this week" or "next month," `usePeriodForDate` can be leveraged to dynamically determine these periods and fetch the relevant data.

This hook ensures that date-related logic is centralized and reusable across different components within the calendar feature.
