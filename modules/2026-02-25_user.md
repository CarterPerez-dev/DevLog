## Module Overview

# User Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/user` package is part of the social-media-notes application, focusing on managing user-related functionalities such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. This package encapsulates domain logic for users.

## File Relationships
- **User.py**: Contains the `User` class definition, representing a user entity.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the module, making its contents accessible.
- **dependencies.py**: Houses dependencies required by other modules within this package.
- **repository.py**: Manages data access for users, interacting with the database through SQLAlchemy models.
- **routes.py**: Defines RESTful API routes for user-related operations.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for validating and serializing user data.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic using the repository to perform CRUD operations on user entities.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- User entity (`User` class)
- Repository methods (CRUD operations)
- Service methods (business logic)
- Schemas for validation

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or extend user-related features in the application. For instance, creating new user endpoints in `routes.py`, validating user data using schemas defined in `schemas.py`, and performing database operations via the repository in `repository.py`.
