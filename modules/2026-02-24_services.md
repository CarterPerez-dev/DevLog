## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/services

## Purpose and Scope
The `auth.services` package contains business logic for authentication services in the CarterOS-Server application. This includes managing user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the module and provides a namespace.
- **auth.py**: Contains core authentication functions and classes, handling the overall authentication process.
- **user.py**: Manages user-related operations, including user creation, validation, and retrieval.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Functions for initiating authentication processes in `auth.py`.
- User management functions in `user.py`.

### Example Usage

A developer would use this module when implementing or extending the authentication functionality of CarterOS-Server. For instance, to create a new user or validate an existing one:

```python
from aspects.auth.services import auth, user

# Create a new user
new_user = user.create_user(username="testuser", password="password123")

# Authenticate a user
auth.login("testuser", "password123")
```

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns and provides a robust framework for managing authentication in the application.
