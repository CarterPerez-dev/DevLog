## Module Overview

# backend/services

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/services` package contains core business logic services for the application, including file storage, bulk data upload, and search functionalities.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and sets up explicit imports to prevent circular dependencies.
- **bulk_upload_service.py**: Implements functionality for handling large-scale data uploads, ensuring efficient processing and error handling.
- **search_service.py**: Provides methods for searching through stored data, offering flexible query options and result filtering.
- **storage_service.py**: Manages file storage operations, including uploading, downloading, and managing files in the system.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes and functions for interacting with each service:
- `BulkUploadService` for bulk data uploads.
- `SearchService` for querying stored data.
- `StorageService` for file management tasks.

Type hints, decorators, and context managers are used to ensure robustness and maintainability. Explicit imports in the `__init__.py` facilitate clean usage of these services throughout the application.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when implementing features that require handling bulk data uploads, searching through stored information, or managing files within the system. The clear separation of concerns and explicit API design make it easy to integrate these services into various parts of the backend logic.
