## Module Overview

## Stripe Referral Services Module Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `src/stripe_referral/services` package is designed to handle core business logic related to referrals and payouts in the `stripe-referral` repository. It encapsulates services for managing referral programs and processing payouts.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the public API of the package.
  - **referral_service.py**: Contains the `ReferralService` class responsible for managing referral-related operations such as tracking referrals, awarding bonuses, and handling referral events.
  - **payout_service.py**: Houses the `PayoutService` class which handles the logic for processing payouts to users based on their referral activities.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `ReferralService`: Provides methods for managing referrals and related operations.
- `PayoutService`: Offers functionality for processing payouts, including calculating amounts and triggering Stripe payments.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending the referral program logic. For instance, to create new referral instances, track user referrals, or process payout transactions. The services are designed to be flexible and can be easily integrated into various parts of the application where referral and payout management is required.

This structure ensures that the code remains modular and maintainable, making it easier for developers to understand and extend the functionality as needed.
