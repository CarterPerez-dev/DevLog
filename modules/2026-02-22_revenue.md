## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/revenue

## Purpose and Scope
The `revenue` package in the `backend/api/admin/models` directory is designed to encapsulate models related to subscription-based revenue metrics for administrative purposes. This package focuses on handling subscription events and metrics, providing a structured way to manage and analyze user subscriptions.

## File Relationships
- **SubscriptionEvent.py**: Contains classes and methods for tracking individual subscription-related events (e.g., subscription start, end, renewal).
- **SubscriptionMetrics.py**: Provides classes and methods for calculating aggregate revenue metrics based on the events defined in `SubscriptionEvent.py`.
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for this package, importing and exposing the public API.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `SubscriptionEvent`: Classes representing specific subscription events.
- `SubscriptionMetrics`: Classes and methods for calculating revenue metrics based on these events.

```python
from backend.api.admin.models.revenue import SubscriptionEvent, SubscriptionMetrics

# Example usage
event = SubscriptionEvent(subscription_id=123, event_type='renewal')
metrics = SubscriptionMetrics(events=[event])
print(metrics.calculate_revenue())
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to track and analyze subscription-based revenue metrics. This is particularly useful for backend administrators who require detailed insights into user subscriptions and their financial impact.
