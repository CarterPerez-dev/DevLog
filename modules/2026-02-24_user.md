## Module Overview

### v1/backend/app/user

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `v1/backend/app/user` package encapsulates the user domain logic, including data models, repositories, services, and routes for managing user-related operations in the application.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the module and imports essential components.
- **User.py**: Defines the User model with type hints and validation using Pydantic schemas.
- **repository.py**: Implements database interactions for user data, abstracted through interfaces or concrete implementations.
- **service.py**: Contains business logic that operates on user entities, leveraging the repository to interact with the database.
- **schemas.py**: Houses Pydantic models used for validating user input and output data.
- **routes.py**: Defines API endpoints for handling HTTP requests related to users.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API primarily includes:
- User model (User.py)
- Repository interface or concrete implementations (repository.py)
- Service layer methods (service.py)
- Route definitions (routes.py)

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when they need to manage user-related functionalities, such as creating, updating, and retrieving user data. The module provides the necessary abstractions for handling user operations in a clean and maintainable manner.
