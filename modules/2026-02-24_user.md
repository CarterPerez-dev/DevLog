## Module Overview

### fastapi/app/user — User Domain

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `fastapi/app/user` package is designed to encapsulate all user-related functionality within an application, including models, repositories, services, dependencies, and routes. This package adheres to the principles of clean architecture by separating concerns into distinct modules.

**File Relationships:**
- **User.py**: Contains the User model definition with type hints.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the module and imports key components for easy access.
- **dependencies.py**: Houses dependency injection logic, ensuring that services and repositories are properly initialized.
- **repository.py**: Manages data persistence operations using SQLAlchemy models.
- **routes.py**: Defines API endpoints for user-related operations, leveraging FastAPI decorators.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for validating request and response payloads.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic that interacts with the repository to perform CRUD operations.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface includes:
- User model (`User` class)
- Dependency injection functions
- Repository methods (CRUD operations)
- Service methods (business logic)
- Route definitions

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when building or extending the user management functionality in their FastAPI application. They can utilize the provided models, services, and routes to implement user authentication, registration, profile management, and other related features.
