## Module Overview

# backend/app/admin

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/admin` package is designed to manage administrative functionalities within the social-media-notes application. It encapsulates logic related to user management, content moderation, and other high-level operations that require elevated permissions.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the admin module. It initializes any necessary configurations or dependencies.
- **routes.py**: Contains the routing definitions for administrative endpoints. These routes handle requests related to admin functionalities such as user management and content moderation.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily exposed through the `routes.py` file, which defines URL patterns and corresponding view functions. Developers can interact with these routes via HTTP requests to perform administrative tasks.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or test administrative features of the application. For example, setting up user roles, managing content moderation queues, or handling sensitive data operations that require authentication and authorization checks.

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns and makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the administrative functionalities within the social-media-notes application.
