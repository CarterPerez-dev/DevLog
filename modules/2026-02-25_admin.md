## Module Overview

# fastapi/app/admin

## Purpose and Scope

The `fastapi/app/admin` package is part of the `ios-test` repository, focusing on administrative functionalities within an application built using FastAPI. This package encapsulates logic related to backend administration tasks, ensuring secure and efficient management of system resources.

## File Structure

- **`__init__.py`**: This file serves as the entry point for the `admin` module. It contains metadata such as copyright information.
  
- **`routes.py`**: Contains the core administrative routes and endpoints that define how requests are handled by the FastAPI application. These routes interact with various services to perform administrative tasks.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface is defined in `routes.py`, which exports several functions and classes responsible for handling HTTP requests related to administration. Developers can use this package to extend or modify these endpoints as needed, ensuring that only authorized users can access administrative features.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with the `fastapi/app/admin` module when they need to implement or customize administrative functionalities in their FastAPI application. This might include setting up user management, managing configurations, or handling sensitive data operations. By leveraging this package, developers can maintain a clean and organized codebase while ensuring that administrative tasks are handled securely and efficiently.
