## Module Overview

# frontend/src/core/socket

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/core/socket` package is designed to handle WebSocket communication in the Vue semantics application, providing a robust framework for real-time data exchange.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point, exporting all public APIs from sub-modules.
- **socket.client.ts**: Contains client-side WebSocket logic and utility functions.
- **socket.types.ts**: Defines types and interfaces used throughout the package.
- **useBatchProgress.ts**, **useFileProgress.ts**, **useSocket.ts**, **useUploadProgress.ts**: Provide custom hooks for managing file uploads, batch operations, and socket interactions.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `useSocket`: A hook to manage WebSocket connections.
- `useFileProgress`, `useBatchProgress`, `useUploadProgress`: Custom hooks for handling file upload progress and batch operation tracking.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when implementing real-time features in the application, such as file uploads or socket-based communication. These hooks simplify complex WebSocket operations, making it easier to integrate real-time functionality into components.
