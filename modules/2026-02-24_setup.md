## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/app/setup

## Purpose and Scope

The `setup` package in the `CarterOS-Server` project is responsible for initializing various components of the server application, including middleware configuration, exception handling, CORS settings, health checks, and lifecycle management. This package ensures that the server is properly configured before it starts serving requests.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and sets up any necessary configurations.
- **cors.py**: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which origins are allowed to access the API.
- **exceptions.py**: Defines custom exceptions used throughout the application, providing a consistent way to handle errors.
- **health.py**: Implements health check endpoints for monitoring the server's status and availability.
- **lifespan.py**: Manages the lifecycle of the server, including startup and shutdown procedures.
- **middleware.py**: Configures and applies middleware functions that run before or after request handling.

## Public API Surface

The public API primarily includes:
- Middleware configuration via `middleware.py`.
- Exception handling through classes defined in `exceptions.py`.
- CORS policy setup in `cors.py`.
- Health check endpoints managed by `health.py`.
- Lifecycle management methods in `lifespan.py`.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this package when setting up the server environment, configuring middleware and exception handling, managing CORS policies, implementing health checks, and ensuring proper lifecycle management. This package is essential for anyone working on the server setup or configuration aspects of the `CarterOS-Server` project.
