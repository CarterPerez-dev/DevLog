## Module Overview

### CarterOS-Server/src/core/foundation/repositories

#### Purpose and Scope
The `foundation/repositories` package in the `CarterOS-Server` project is designed to provide foundational data access layers for various operations within the server. It encapsulates common database interactions, ensuring consistency and abstraction across different modules.

#### File Relationships
1. **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the repository module, importing essential classes and functions from other files.
2. **base.py**: Contains abstract base class definitions for repositories, setting up a standard interface that all specific repositories must adhere to.
3. **identity.py**: Implements concrete repository classes specifically for handling identity-related data such as user accounts and roles.
4. **identity_mutations.py**: Provides mutation methods (CRUD operations) for the `identity` repository, ensuring encapsulated and type-safe interactions.

#### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Abstract base class definitions in `base.py`.
- Concrete repository classes in `identity.py`, such as `UserRepository` and `RoleRepository`.
- Mutation methods defined in `identity_mutations.py`.

#### When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to perform database operations related to user identity management. For instance, creating a new user account or updating role permissions. The structured approach ensures that all identity-related data access follows consistent patterns and practices.
