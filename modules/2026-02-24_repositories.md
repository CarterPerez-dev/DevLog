## Module Overview

### CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/repositories

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package contains repositories for managing authentication-related operations in the CarterOS server application, specifically focusing on user and refresh token management.

**File Relationships:**
- **`__init__.py`:** This file serves as an initialization module. It is automatically executed when any other module from this package is imported.
- **`user.py`:** Contains classes and methods for managing user-related operations such as user creation, authentication, and retrieval.
- **`refresh_token.py`:** Manages refresh tokens used in the authentication process to extend session validity.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- Classes like `UserRepository` for handling user data interactions.
- Methods within these classes that provide CRUD operations on users and refresh tokens.
- Type hints and decorators are used to ensure type safety and improve code readability.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when implementing or extending the authentication system in CarterOS. Specifically, they might use `UserRepository` for managing user data and `RefreshTokenRepository` for handling token-related operations. This module is particularly useful during development and testing phases to ensure secure and efficient user management.
