## Module Overview

### Documentation for `PROJECTS/advanced/bug-bounty-platform/backend/app/auth`

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `auth` package is part of the backend application for a bug bounty platform, focusing on authentication mechanisms such as token management, user validation, and route handling. It ensures secure access control and integrates with other components like repositories and services.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **RefreshToken.py**: Handles logic related to refresh tokens.
- **dependencies.py**: Manages dependencies required by the module.
- **repository.py**: Interacts with the database for authentication-related operations.
- **routes.py**: Defines API routes and their corresponding handlers.
- **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for validation of request and response data.
- **service.py**: Implements core business logic related to user authentication.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- `RefreshToken` class (defined in RefreshToken.py) for managing refresh tokens.
- Functions and classes defined in repository.py, routes.py, and service.py that are exposed via the module's public interface.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when implementing or extending authentication features in the bug bounty platform. Specifically, they might use it to:
- Define custom authentication routes by importing handlers from `routes.py`.
- Validate user credentials and manage tokens using classes and functions from `service.py` and `repository.py`.
