## Module Overview

# fastapi/tests/integration

## Purpose and Scope
The `fastapi/tests/integration` package is designed for integration testing of various components within the FastAPI application, ensuring that different parts work seamlessly together. This includes testing functionalities related to authentication, user management, administrative tasks, and health checks.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: The initialization file that organizes and imports all test modules.
- **test_admin.py**: Contains tests for administrative functions.
- **test_auth.py**: Focuses on authentication mechanisms.
- **test_health.py**: Tests the health check endpoints to ensure they respond correctly under various conditions.
- **test_users.py**: Covers user-related functionalities, including registration, login, and profile management.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily defined by the test functions within each module. These tests are executed using a testing framework like pytest. Developers can run these tests to validate the application's behavior under different scenarios without affecting the live environment.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package during the development and integration phases of the FastAPI project. Running the test suite ensures that new features or changes do not break existing functionalities, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the application.
