## Module Overview

# backend/tests/integration

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/tests/integration` package contains integration tests for various components of the social-media-notes application. These tests are designed to validate interactions between different parts of the system, ensuring that they work together as expected.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and imports all test modules.
- **test_admin.py**: Contains tests related to administrative functionalities.
- **test_auth.py**: Tests authentication mechanisms within the application.
- **test_health.py**: Ensures the health checks are functioning correctly.
- **test_users.py**: Validates user-related operations.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily internal and not intended for direct use by other developers. The tests defined in this package are run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that integration points remain functional over time.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module during development or when setting up their local environment to run comprehensive test suites. It is also useful for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes to automatically validate the application's behavior under various scenarios.

This package serves as a critical safety net, helping maintain the integrity of the system by catching issues early in the development cycle.
