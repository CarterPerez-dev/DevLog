## Module Overview

# backend/app/wake

## Purpose and Scope
The `wake` package in the `backend/app` directory is designed to handle wake-related functionalities for the application, including routing, schema validation, and service operations.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package by importing the `router` module. It also exports the `router` object via the `__all__` list.
- **router.py**: Contains the routing logic for handling wake-related API endpoints.
- **schemas.py**: Defines Pydantic schemas used for validating data structures in requests and responses.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic and interacts with other services or databases to process wake-related operations.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is exposed via `__init__.py` through the `router` object. Developers can import this router directly into their application's main routing file to include wake-related endpoints in the overall API.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to define and handle wake-related functionalities within the application. Specifically, developers will interact with it by importing the `router` object from `backend/app/wake` into their main routing configuration file to set up endpoints for handling wake data.
