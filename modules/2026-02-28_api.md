## Module Overview

# advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/api

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains the API layer for the threat detection system, handling data ingestion, model interactions, health checks, and real-time threat notifications.

## File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the module.
- **`deps.py`**: Manages dependencies required by the API components.
- **`health.py`**: Implements health check endpoints to monitor service status.
- **`ingest.py`**: Handles data ingestion and preprocessing for threat detection models.
- **`models_api.py`**: Exposes model APIs, facilitating interactions with machine learning models.
- **`stats.py`**: Provides statistical analysis of detected threats and system performance metrics.
- **`threats.py`**: Manages threat detection logic and real-time threat notifications.
- **`websocket.py`**: Implements WebSocket communication for real-time updates.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- Health check endpoints in `health.py`.
- Ingestion methods in `ingest.py`.
- Model interaction APIs in `models_api.py`.
- Real-time threat notifications via WebSockets in `websocket.py`.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when setting up or extending the backend API for the threat detection system, particularly during integration testing and real-time data processing.
