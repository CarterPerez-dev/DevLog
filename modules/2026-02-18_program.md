- **routes.py**: Exposes API endpoints related to programs.
- **schemas.py**: Defines data validation schemas for program-related operations.
- **service.py**: Provides higher-level services that integrate various components.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface includes:
- `Program` class and its methods in `Program.py`.
- `RewardTier` class and its methods in `RewardTier.py`.
- Various routes defined in `routes.py`.

**When to Use This Module:**
