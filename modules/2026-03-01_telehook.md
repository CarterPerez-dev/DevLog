## Module Overview

# src/telehook

## Purpose and Scope
The `src/telehook` package is designed for sending notifications via various messaging services, such as Telegram or Slack. It encapsulates the logic required to configure, create messages, and send them using different transport mechanisms.

## File Relationships
- **config.py**: Defines the configuration settings for the telehook system.
- **message.py**: Contains classes and methods for constructing and formatting messages that will be sent.
- **notifier.py**: Implements the core functionality of sending notifications based on the configured settings and message content.
- **transport.py**: Provides the transport layer, handling the actual delivery of messages to external services.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `TelehookConfig`: For setting up configuration parameters.
- `Message`: For creating and formatting messages.
- `Notifier`: The primary class for sending notifications using configured transports.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this package when they need to integrate notification capabilities into their applications. They can configure the system with `TelehookConfig`, create and format messages with `Message`, and send these messages via `Notifier`. This structure allows for easy extension and customization of message delivery mechanisms.
