## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/security/rate_limit

## Purpose and Scope

This package is part of the `CarterOS-Server` project, specifically designed for managing rate limits in various server operations to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `rate_limit` module. It imports and initializes the core functionality provided by `limiter.py`.
  
- **limiter.py**: Contains the primary implementation of rate limiting mechanisms, including decorators and context managers to enforce limits on function calls or operations.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Decorators: `@rate_limit` for function-based rate limiting.
- Context Managers: `RateLimitContext` for managing rate-limited blocks of code.
- Utility functions for configuring and inspecting rate limit settings.

```python
from .limiter import rate_limit, RateLimitContext

# Example usage in a view or service
@rate_limit(limit=10, period=60)
def handle_request(request):
    # Handle request logic here
```

## When to Use This Module

Developers would use this module when implementing server-side services that need to enforce rate limits. It is particularly useful for APIs, user actions, and any operation where limiting the frequency of calls is necessary.

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns and provides a robust framework for managing rate limits across the `CarterOS-Server` project.
