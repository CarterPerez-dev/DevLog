## Module Overview

# ai-threat-detection/backend/cli

## Purpose and Scope
The `ai-threat-detection/backend/cli` package is designed to provide command-line interface (CLI) tools for interacting with the threat detection backend of an advanced AI system. This package facilitates easy setup, configuration, and execution of threat detection tasks without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying codebase.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the CLI module. It initializes any necessary configurations or dependencies.
- **main.py**: Contains the core logic for handling command-line arguments and invoking the backend services to perform threat detection tasks.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily exposed through functions defined in `main.py`. Developers can interact with this package by running specific CLI commands, such as:
```bash
python -m ai-threat-detection.backend.cli --help
```
This command provides a list of available subcommands and their usage.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to test or integrate the threat detection backend with other systems via a CLI interface. It is particularly useful for system administrators, security analysts, or developers who require quick access to the AI threat detection capabilities without modifying the core codebase.

This structure ensures that the CLI tools are easily accessible and maintainable, providing a clear separation between the backend logic and the user interaction layer.
