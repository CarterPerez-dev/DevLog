## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Client/src/core/state Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `CarterOS-Client/src/core/state` module manages the core state management for the CarterOS client application, focusing on authentication and shell user interface states.

## File Relationships
- **auth.store.ts**: Manages authentication-related state, including login status, user credentials, and session information.
- **shell.ui.store.ts**: Handles state related to the shell user interface, such as active tabs, input history, and current commands.
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point for this module, re-exporting the public API from `auth.store` and `shell.ui.store`.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Authentication-related state management functions and types.
- Shell UI state management functions and types.

```typescript
// Example usage of exported APIs
import { useAuthState } from './auth.store';
import { useShellUIState } from './shell.ui.store';

const authState = useAuthState();
const shellUIState = useShellUIState();
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage or access the application's core state, particularly for authentication and shell UI functionalities.
