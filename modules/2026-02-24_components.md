## Module Overview

# frontend/src/core/components

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/core/components` package is part of the `vuemantics` repository, focusing on reusable UI components that provide core functionality for the application. This package specifically contains generic, high-level components essential for various parts of the user interface.

## File Relationships
- **GlobalBatchIndicator.tsx**: A React component designed to display a global batch processing indicator in the application.
- **index.ts**: An export file that reexports all components from `GlobalBatchIndicator.tsx` into the parent directory, facilitating easy import and usage across different modules.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
```typescript
export { GlobalBatchIndicator } from './GlobalBatchIndicator';
```

This allows developers to use the `GlobalBatchIndicator` component directly in their code with a single import statement.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need a global, consistent indicator for batch processing tasks throughout the application. Importing and using `GlobalBatchIndicator` ensures that such indicators are uniform and maintainable across different parts of the UI.
