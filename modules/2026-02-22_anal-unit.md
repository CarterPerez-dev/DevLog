## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/qa/anal_unit Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/admin/models/qa/anal_unit` package is designed for quality assurance (QA) of models related to administrative units in the CertGames-Core repository. It contains various model classes that represent different types of metrics and logs used to monitor and analyze performance, errors, and other critical data points.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the QA module unit.
- **qa_database_metrics_models.py**: Contains models for database-related metrics.
- **qa_endpoint_metrics_models.py**: Models for endpoint-specific metrics.
- **qa_error_log_models.py**: Models for error logs to track issues and anomalies.
- **qa_performance_metric_models.py**: Metrics related to overall system performance.
- **qa_web_vital_models.py**: Models for web vitals, such as load times and user experience indicators.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes the model classes defined in each file. Developers can interact with these models through their respective class names, which are documented within each file. The package provides a structured way to handle different types of QA-related data, ensuring consistency and ease of use.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or query specific metrics related to administrative units in the CertGames-Core application. For instance, when setting up monitoring systems, performing performance optimizations, or troubleshooting issues by analyzing error logs.
