## Module Overview

## backend/services/ai

### Purpose and Scope
The `backend/services/ai` package provides local AI services for model inference, including text embeddings, vision processing, and prompt management.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Exports the public API.
- **embedding.py**: Contains `EmbeddingService` for generating and managing text embeddings.
- **manager.py**: Manages Ollama models and their configurations.
- **prompts.py**: Handles prompt generation and customization.
- **regenerate.py**: Provides functionality to regenerate descriptions or outputs based on user inputs.
- **service.py**: Defines the base `LocalAIService` class, which is extended by other services.
- **vision.py**: Implements `VisionService` for image processing tasks.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `OllamaManager`: Manages Ollama models and configurations.
- `EmbeddingService`: Generates text embeddings.
- `LocalAIService`: Base class for local AI services.
- `VisionService`: Processes images using local models.
- `regenerate_upload_description`: Regenerates descriptions based on user inputs.

### When to Use
Developers would interact with this package when implementing or integrating local AI services into the application. The public API allows easy instantiation and use of various AI services, making it suitable for tasks such as embedding generation, image processing, and model management.
