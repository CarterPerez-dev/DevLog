## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/schemas

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains schemas for authentication-related data models in the CarterOS server application. It ensures that user and authorization data are validated consistently across different parts of the system.

## File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`:** This file serves as the entry point for the `auth/schemas` package, providing a clean namespace.
- **`auth.py`:** Contains common authentication schemas used throughout the application. It defines validation rules and structures for various authentication-related data.
- **`user.py`:** Specifically focuses on user-related schemas, including details like username, email, and roles.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `UserSchema` from `user.py`: A schema for validating and serializing user data.
- `AuthSchema` from `auth.py`: A schema for handling authentication processes, such as login and registration.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to validate or serialize user-related data during authentication processes. For example, when setting up a new user account, validating login credentials, or ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before being stored in the database.
