## Module Overview

# backend/schemas

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/schemas` package defines data models and response structures for various services within the application, ensuring consistency and clarity in data handling.

## File Relationships
- **base.py**: Provides common base classes like `PaginationParams`, `PaginatedResponse`, and `TimestampMixin`.
- **common.py**: Contains shared responses like `AppInfoResponse`.
- **auth.py**: Manages authentication-related schemas such as login requests, token responses, and password reset.
- **client_config.py**: Defines the structure for client configuration responses.
- **user.py**: Handles user-related schemas including creation, update, and response models.
- **upload.py**: Schemas related to file uploads, including upload lists and bulk operations.
- **search.py**: Structures for search requests and results.
- **health.py**: Health check schemas.
- **changelog.py**: Changelog section and version schemas.

## Public API Surface
The package exports a wide range of classes and types used across the application. Developers interact with these to ensure data integrity and consistency in API responses and request payloads.

## When to Use
Developers would use this module when defining or validating input parameters, constructing response objects, or handling data structures related to user authentication, client configurations, uploads, searches, health checks, and changelogs.
