## Module Overview

# codeworm/scheduler

## Purpose and Scope
The `codeworm/scheduler` package is designed to facilitate the scheduling of tasks in Python applications, providing a flexible and human-friendly way to manage scheduled jobs.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the module. It imports all necessary classes and functions from `scheduler.py`, making them accessible when the package is imported.
- **scheduler.py**: Contains the core logic for scheduling tasks, including the `CodeWormScheduler` class and related utility functions.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `CodeWormScheduler`: A scheduler class that manages scheduled tasks.
- `DailySchedule`: Represents a daily schedule pattern.
- `HumanLikeTrigger`: A trigger mechanism to mimic human-like scheduling patterns.
- `ScheduledTask`: Describes a task to be scheduled.
- `create_scheduler`: A utility function to instantiate the `CodeWormScheduler`.

## When to Use
Developers would use this module when they need to schedule tasks in their applications, such as running maintenance routines at specific times or intervals. The human-friendly triggers and flexible scheduling options make it suitable for both simple and complex task management scenarios.

This package is particularly useful in applications where precise timing and ease of configuration are crucial.
