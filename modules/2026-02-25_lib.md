## Module Overview

### red-recon/src/core/lib

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `red-recon/src/core/lib` package serves as a foundational library for handling core functionalities in the `ios-test` repository, specifically focusing on authentication (`auth.store`) and user interface state management (`ui.store`). This module is designed to provide reusable components that can be easily integrated into various parts of the application.

**File Relationships:**
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, re-exporting functionalities from `auth.store` and `ui.store`. It ensures a clean import mechanism for other modules.
- **auth.store.ts**: Manages authentication-related state and logic. This file encapsulates all necessary functions and states related to user login, registration, and session management.
- **ui.store.ts**: Handles UI-related state such as loading indicators, error messages, and theme settings. It ensures that the application's visual elements are responsive to various state changes.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes re-exported types, functions, and states from `auth.store` and `ui.store`. Developers can import these directly using:
```typescript
import { AuthState, login } from 'red-recon/src/core/lib/auth.store';
import { UIState, setTheme } from 'red-recon/src/core/lib/ui.store';
```

**When to Use:**
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage authentication states and user interface elements across the application. This package is particularly useful for ensuring consistent state handling and providing a clear API surface for other modules to consume.
