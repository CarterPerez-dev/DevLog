## Module Overview

# frontend/src/lib Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `frontend/src/lib` module in the `angelamos-3d` repository is designed to encapsulate reusable utility functions, components, and services for the front-end application. It primarily focuses on enhancing the user experience through animations, audio handling, debugging tools, and wake-word detection functionalities.

## File Relationships

- **debug.ts**: Contains logging and debugging utilities.
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, exporting all sub-modules: `animation`, `audio`, `debug`, and `wakeword`. This centralizes the API surface for easier access to related functionality.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Animation-related functions
- Audio handling utilities
- Debugging tools (logging, error tracking)
- Wake-word detection services

All exports from sub-modules are accessible via `frontend/src/lib`.

## Developer Usage

Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or enhance functionalities such as smooth animations, audio playback, debugging support, and wake-word recognition. By importing the relevant sub-modules through `frontend/src/lib`, developers can easily integrate these features into their components or services without duplicating code.
