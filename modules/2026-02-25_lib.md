## Module Overview

### frontend/src/core/lib

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `frontend/src/core/lib` package provides core utility stores for managing application state, specifically focusing on authentication (`auth.store`) and draft management (`draft.store`). These stores are essential for maintaining consistent and reactive state across the application.

**File Relationships:**
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting functions to interact with `auth.store` and `draft.store`.
- **auth.store.ts**: Manages user authentication-related state.
- **draft.store.ts**: Handles draft notes or content management.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- `useAuthStore`: A hook for managing and accessing authentication state.
- `useDraftStore`: A hook for handling and manipulating draft data.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage user authentication or handle draft content in their components. By importing these hooks, developers can easily access the necessary state management functionalities without needing to directly manipulate the underlying store logic.
