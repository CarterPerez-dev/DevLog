## Module Overview

# frontend/src/lib Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `frontend/src/lib` module is a collection of utility functions, components, and services used across various parts of the application. It includes modules for handling animations, audio interactions, debugging tools, and wake-word detection.

## File Relationships

- **debug.ts**: Contains logging, tracing, and debugging utilities to help developers monitor and debug the application.
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, exporting all functionalities from sub-modules like `animation`, `audio`, `wakeword`, and `debug`.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes exports from each sub-module:
- Animation-related functions and classes
- Audio handling utilities
- Debugging tools for tracing and logging
- Wake-word detection services

Exported types, functions, and constants are accessible via `import { * } from 'frontend/src/lib'`.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need:
- Animation effects in components or pages.
- Audio playback or recording functionalities.
- Debugging tools for troubleshooting issues.
- Wake-word detection features for voice commands.

This module provides a centralized location for commonly used utilities, making the codebase more maintainable and reusable.
