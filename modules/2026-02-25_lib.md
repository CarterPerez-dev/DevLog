## Module Overview

# core/lib Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `core/lib` module in the CodeWorm repository is designed to provide foundational utilities and state management for the frontend dashboard application. It encapsulates reusable components and stores that are critical for maintaining consistent state across different parts of the UI.

## File Relationships
- **dashboard.store.ts**: Manages the global state related to the dashboard, including data fetching, user interactions, and other dynamic content.
- **shell.ui.store.ts**: Handles the state management specific to the shell UI components, such as navigation, layout settings, and theme preferences.
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point for importing the public API from `dashboard.store` and `shell.ui.store`.

## Public API Surface
The module exposes two primary functions through its `index.ts` file:
- `useDashboardStore`: A React hook that provides access to the dashboard state and actions.
- `useUIStore`: A React hook that offers access to shell UI-related state and actions.

These hooks enable developers to easily integrate state management into components without needing to import individual stores directly.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage or consume state within the dashboard frontend. By leveraging `useDashboardStore` and `useUIStore`, developers can ensure consistent and efficient state handling across their application, making it easier to maintain and scale the codebase.
