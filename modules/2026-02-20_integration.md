## Module Overview

## Integration Tests for Bug Bounty Platform Backend

### Purpose and Scope
This package contains integration tests for various components of the `backend` module in the `bug-bounty-platform` project. These tests ensure that different parts of the backend system work together as expected, focusing on real-world scenarios.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: The entry point for this test suite.
- **test_admin.py**: Tests functionalities related to admin users and their privileges.
- **test_auth.py**: Validates authentication mechanisms across the application.
- **test_health.py**: Ensures that health checks and monitoring systems are functioning correctly.
- **test_users.py**: Verifies user-related operations, including registration, login, and profile management.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily internal to this testing module. It includes test functions and fixtures defined in each of the sub-modules. Developers do not directly interact with these tests but may use them indirectly by running the test suite as part of their development or deployment process.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this package when they want to ensure that changes made to the backend components do not break existing functionality in an integrated manner. Running these tests helps maintain system reliability and security, especially during critical phases like feature development or bug fixes.
