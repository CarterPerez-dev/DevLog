## Module Overview

# core/features

## Purpose and Scope
The `core/features` package in the `backend/app` directory of the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection` repository is designed to encapsulate specific threat detection features used within the application. It contains modules that handle data extraction, encoding, aggregation, and pattern recognition for identifying potential threats.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **aggregator.py**: Manages the collection and consolidation of threat data from various sources.
- **encoder.py**: Implements encoders to transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
- **extractor.py**: Extracts relevant features from network traffic or other data streams.
- **mappings.py**: Contains mappings and configurations used across different modules.
- **patterns.py**: Defines patterns and rules for identifying suspicious activities.
- **signatures.py**: Stores predefined signatures of known threats.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes classes, functions, and methods defined in `aggregator.py`, `encoder.py`, `extractor.py`, and `patterns.py`. These provide the core functionality for threat detection. Developers can interact with these modules to integrate custom features or modify existing ones.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this package when they need to extend or customize the threat detection capabilities of the application. For example, adding new data extraction methods in `extractor.py`, defining new threat patterns in `patterns.py`, or integrating custom encoders in `encoder.py`.
