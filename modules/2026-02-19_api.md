## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/app/api`

## Purpose and Scope

The `api` package in the `backend/app` directory is designed to handle all aspects of threat detection APIs within the AI Threat Detection system. It encompasses API endpoints, health checks, model interactions, and real-time threat updates.

## File Relationships

- **`__init__.py`:** Initializes the package and imports essential modules.
- **`deps.py`:** Manages dependencies required by the API.
- **`health.py`:** Contains health check functions to ensure the API is operational.
- **`models_api.py`:** Interacts with machine learning models for threat detection.
- **`stats.py`:** Handles statistical data and metrics related to threats.
- **`threats.py`:** Manages real-time threat updates and detections.
- **`websocket.py`:** Implements WebSocket communication for live updates.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
- `health.check()`: A function to verify the health of the API.
- `models_api.predict()`: A method to predict threats using machine learning models.
- `threats.update()`: A function to update threat statuses in real-time.
- WebSocket endpoints for live data streaming.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this package when they need to:
- Implement or test API endpoints related to threat detection.
- Ensure the system's health and availability through health checks.
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Handle real-time updates of threat statuses.
- Stream live data using WebSocket connections.
