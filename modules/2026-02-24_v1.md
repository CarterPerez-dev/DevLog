## Module Overview

## backend/routers/v1

### Purpose and Scope
The `backend/routers/v1` package contains the version 1 API routers for the Vuemantics backend service, providing structured endpoints for various functionalities such as authentication, bulk uploads, changelogs, client configurations, health checks, file uploads, search operations, and WebSocket communication.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package by importing sub-modules and including their routers under a main `router` object. This centralizes API routing for version 1.
- **auth.py, bulk_upload.py, changelog.py, client_config.py, health.py, upload.py, search.py, websocket.py**: These files define individual routers for specific functionalities, each tagged appropriately to categorize endpoints.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes the `router` object and sub-modules. Developers can interact with this package by importing the `router` from `backend/routers/v1`, which provides access to all defined endpoints in version 1 of the API.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when implementing or testing version 1 of the backend service's API. By including the `router` object, they can integrate these endpoints into their application logic, ensuring that users have access to the necessary functionalities through well-defined and structured APIs.
