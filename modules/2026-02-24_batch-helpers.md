## Module Overview

### backend/workers/batch_helpers

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package provides helper functions for batch processing tasks, specifically designed to handle file uploads and progress tracking in a robust manner.

**File Relationships:**
- `__init__.py` serves as the entry point, importing and exporting all public functions.
- `_process_upload_with_retry.py` contains logic to process file uploads with retry mechanisms to ensure reliability.
- `_publish_batch_progress.py` handles publishing batch-level progress updates.
- `_publish_file_progress.py` manages individual file progress reporting.

**Public API Surface:**
The package exposes three main functions:
- `publish_batch_progress`: Updates the overall status of a batch processing job.
- `publish_file_progress`: Tracks and reports the progress of individual files within a batch.
- `process_upload_with_retry`: Processes file uploads with retry logic to handle transient errors.

**When to Use:**
Developers would interact with this package when implementing or integrating batch processing workflows that require reliable file handling and real-time progress updates. This module ensures that both batch-level and file-level progress are tracked effectively, providing a robust solution for complex data processing tasks.
