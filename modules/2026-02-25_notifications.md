## Module Overview

## Module Documentation: red-recon/src/core/notifications

### Purpose and Scope
The `red-recon/src/core/notifications` module is part of the `ios-test` repository, designed to handle notification-related functionalities within the application. This module ensures that notifications are managed consistently across different parts of the application.

### File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for the `notifications` module. It re-exports all public members from `notification.service.ts`, making them accessible directly under the `notifications` namespace.
- **notification.service.ts**: Contains the core logic and services responsible for handling notifications, including their creation, management, and delivery.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes methods and classes exported by `notification.service.ts`. These are re-exported via `index.ts`, allowing developers to interact with notification functionalities without needing to import from multiple files. The public API surface is focused on providing a clean interface for managing notifications within the application.

### When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module whenever they need to implement or manage notifications in their application logic. Whether it's sending push notifications, handling local notifications, or integrating with external notification services, the `notifications` module provides the necessary tools and abstractions to handle these tasks effectively.
