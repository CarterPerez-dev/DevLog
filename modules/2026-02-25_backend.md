## Module Overview

# dashboard/backend

## Purpose and Scope
The `dashboard/backend` package serves as the core backend logic for the CodeWorm application, handling business operations, data models, and API endpoints.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package and imports key components from other modules.
- **api.py**: Contains API-related functions and classes, interfacing with external services or clients.
- **app.py**: Manages the application's main entry point, setting up routes and configurations.
- **models.py**: Houses data models used for database interactions, ensuring consistent and validated data handling.
- **ws.py**: Implements WebSocket handlers for real-time communication.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `api.py`: Exposes API endpoints through functions and classes.
- `app.py`: Provides the main application instance with routes and configurations.
- `models.py`: Offers model classes for database interactions, including type hints and validation logic.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when setting up or extending backend functionality. For example:
- Configuring API endpoints in `app.py` during development.
- Defining data models in `models.py` to ensure consistent data handling.
- Implementing WebSocket handlers in `ws.py` for real-time communication needs.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and maintainable.
