## Module Overview

# backend/models

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/models` package contains core database models for the Vuemantics repository, focusing on entities such as users and file uploads.

## File Relationships
- **Base.py**: Defines base model classes with common attributes and methods.
- **Upload.py**: Implements individual file upload models, inheriting from `Base`.
- **UploadBatch.py**: Manages batch uploads, extending functionality provided by the `Upload` model.
- **User.py**: Represents user entities, including their interactions with the system.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Base Model Classes: `Base`, `Upload`, and `UploadBatch`
- User Model Class: `User`

### Example Usage
Developers would interact with this package when setting up database schemas or performing CRUD operations on user data and file uploads. For instance, to create a new user:

```python
from backend.models import User

user = User(username="john_doe", email="john@example.com")
user.save()
```

To handle batch uploads:

```python
from backend.models import UploadBatch

batch = UploadBatch(description="Weekly Report Files")
for file in files:
    upload = Upload(file_path=file.path, batch=batch)
    upload.save()
```

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes reusability across different parts of the application.
