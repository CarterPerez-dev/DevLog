## Module Overview

### CarterOS-Server/src/aspects/auth/models

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package contains essential models for managing authentication in the CarterOS server application. It includes classes for `User` and `RefreshToken`, which are central to user identity and session management.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point, importing and exposing the public API of the sub-modules.
- **User.py**: Defines the `User` model class, encapsulating user-related data and behaviors.
- **RefreshToken.py**: Implements the `RefreshToken` model class, handling token-based authentication and session management.

**Public API Surface:**
The package exposes two primary classes:
- `User`: Represents a user entity with attributes like username, password hash, email, etc., and methods for validation and interaction.
- `RefreshToken`: Manages refresh tokens used to extend user sessions without requiring re-authentication.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when implementing or extending authentication features in the CarterOS server. Specifically, they would use these models to create, validate, and manage user accounts and their session tokens during login, logout, and token refresh operations.
