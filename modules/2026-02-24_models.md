## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/foundation/models

## Purpose and Scope
This package serves as the foundational model layer for the CarterOS-Server, encapsulating core identity-related data structures essential for user management, content generation, and strategic planning.

## File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`**: This file acts as an entry point, importing all relevant classes from `identity.py`. It ensures that users can access these models through a single interface.
- **`identity.py`**: Contains the detailed implementation of various identity-related classes such as skills, interests, certifications, strengths, weaknesses, and more. These classes are designed to capture comprehensive user profiles.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `CoreIdentity`: Represents a complete user profile with nested attributes like skills, interests, etc.
- `IdentitySkill`, `IdentityInterest`, `IdentityCertification`, `IdentityStrength`, `IdentityWeakness`: Specific attributes of the `CoreIdentity`.
- `BrandVoice`, `BrandVoiceAvoid`, `PlatformGoal`, `RevenueGoal`, `ContentPillar`, `ContentPreference`: Strategic elements used for content and platform goals.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when building user profiles, managing user data, or defining strategic goals. It is particularly useful in modules related to user authentication, profile management, and content generation logic.
