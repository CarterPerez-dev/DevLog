## Module Overview

# app/models

## Purpose and Scope
The `app/models` package in the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend` directory is designed to encapsulate models related to threat detection, including metadata about machine learning models and specific threat events.

## File Relationships
- **base.py**: Contains base classes or common functionalities shared by other model-related files.
- **model_metadata.py**: Defines the `ModelMetadata` class, which holds information about various machine learning models used in the system.
- **threat_event.py**: Implements the `ThreatEvent` class, representing detected threat events and their associated metadata.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `ModelMetadata`: A class for managing model metadata.
- `ThreatEvent`: A class for handling threat event objects.

```python
from app.models.model_metadata import ModelMetadata
from app.models.threat_event import ThreatEvent

# Example usage
model = ModelMetadata(name="MalwareDetector", version="1.0")
event = ThreatEvent(model=model, timestamp="2023-10-01T14:00:00Z", severity="High")
```

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage metadata for machine learning models or handle threat events in the AI-threat-detection system. The `ModelMetadata` class is useful for storing and retrieving model information, while the `ThreatEvent` class helps in logging and processing detected threats.
