## Module Overview

# core/detection

## Purpose and Scope
The `core/detection` package is part of the backend for an advanced AI threat detection system. It encapsulates core functionalities related to threat detection, including ensemble models, inference mechanisms, and rule-based systems.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package and provides a namespace.
- **ensemble.py**: Contains classes and functions for managing ensemble models used in detecting threats.
- **inference.py**: Implements methods for making predictions using various models and rules.
- **rules.py**: Defines rules and conditions that are applied during threat detection.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Classes and functions from `ensemble.py` for model management.
- Functions from `inference.py` for running inference on data.
- Rules defined in `rules.py`.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to integrate threat detection functionalities into the application. Specifically, developers can use:
- Models and their management classes from `ensemble.py`.
- Inference functions from `inference.py` for making predictions.
- Rule definitions from `rules.py` to customize detection logic.

This package is essential for anyone working on enhancing or customizing the AI threat detection capabilities of the application.
