## Module Overview

## Dashboard Module Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `dashboard/frontend/src/pages/dashboard` module is part of the CodeWorm repository, specifically designed for rendering the dashboard page within the frontend application. This module encapsulates the logic and UI components required to display and interact with the dashboard.

### File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point for the `dashboard` module. It exports the `Component` from the `dashboard.tsx`, making it accessible to other parts of the application.
- **dashboard.tsx**: Contains the React component responsible for rendering the dashboard page, including its UI and state management.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
```typescript
export { Component } from './dashboard'
```
This export allows developers to import and use the `Component` directly in other parts of the application.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to render or customize the dashboard page. By importing the `Component`, they can integrate it into their routing configuration or any section where a dashboard view is required, ensuring consistent and maintainable code across the frontend application.
