## Module Overview

# backend/core/docs

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/core/docs` package is designed to manage OpenAPI documentation metadata for the application. It ensures that all necessary information about API endpoints, parameters, and responses is properly documented.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `docs` module. It imports and exposes the `TAGS_METADATA` variable from `tags.py`.
- **tags.py**: Contains metadata related to different API tags (e.g., endpoints, parameters). These details are essential for generating accurate OpenAPI documentation.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface of this package includes:
- `TAGS_METADATA`: A dictionary containing metadata about various API tags. This data is crucial for integrating with tools that generate and validate API documentation.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when setting up or updating the OpenAPI documentation in the application. It is particularly useful during development phases where detailed API descriptions are needed, ensuring consistency and clarity across different parts of the system.
