## Module Overview

# ml

## Purpose and Scope
The `ml` package in the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend` directory is designed to handle machine learning components for threat detection systems. It includes modules responsible for preprocessing data (`scaler.py`) and building robust models using autoencoders (`autoencoder.py`).

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point, importing and exposing the public API from `autoencoder.py` and `scaler.py`.
- **autoencoder.py**: Contains classes and functions for training and deploying autoencoder models. These models are crucial for identifying anomalies in network traffic data.
- **scaler.py**: Implements data scaling utilities to preprocess raw data before it is fed into machine learning models, ensuring that the input data has a consistent scale.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Classes: `AutoEncoderModel` from `autoencoder.py`
- Functions: Data scaling functions from `scaler.py`

```python
from ml.autoencoder import AutoEncoderModel
from ml.scaler import scale_data

# Example usage
model = AutoEncoderModel()
scaled_data = scale_data(raw_data)
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to integrate machine learning capabilities into their threat detection systems. Specifically, they can use the `AutoEncoderModel` class for training and deploying autoencoders and the scaling functions from `scaler.py` to preprocess data effectively.
