## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/infrastructure/database

## Purpose and Scope
The `CarterOS-Server/src/core/infrastructure/database` package provides foundational database infrastructure for the server application, ensuring consistent and efficient interaction with the database layer.

## File Relationships
- **Base.py**: Contains base classes and abstract methods that define common behavior for database entities. It serves as a blueprint for other modules to extend.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package, making its contents accessible to other modules.
- **session.py**: Manages database sessions, providing context managers and utility functions to handle transactions and connections.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `Base` class from Base.py: Defines a base model for database entities with common attributes and methods.
- Session management utilities in session.py: Functions like `start_session()` and `session_context()` facilitate the creation and management of database sessions.

## When to Use This Module
Developers should use this module when they need to interact with the database. The `Base` class provides a standardized model for defining database entities, while session management ensures that database operations are handled efficiently and safely within transactions. Developers can extend the `Base` class to create specific models and utilize session management functions to perform CRUD operations or other database interactions.
