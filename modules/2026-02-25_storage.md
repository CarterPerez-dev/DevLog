## Module Overview

# red-recon/src/core/storage

## Purpose and Scope

The `red-recon/src/core/storage` package is designed to provide secure and efficient storage solutions for application data, focusing on both local and remote storage mechanisms. This module ensures that sensitive information is handled securely while maintaining performance.

## File Relationships

- **secure.storage.ts**: Contains the core logic for handling secure storage operations, including encryption and decryption methods.
- **app.storage.ts**: Implements a higher-level abstraction over `secure.storage` to provide an easy-to-use interface for application-specific storage needs.
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for this module, exporting functionalities from both `secure.storage` and `app.storage`.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Secure Storage Operations: Methods for encrypting, decrypting, and managing secure data.
- Application Storage Interface: Simplified methods tailored for common application storage tasks.

## Developer Usage

Developers would interact with this module when they need to handle sensitive data securely. By importing from `red-recon/src/core/storage`, developers can leverage the secure storage mechanisms without worrying about the underlying implementation details, ensuring that their application's security is robust and maintainable.
