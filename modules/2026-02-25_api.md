## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `dashboard/frontend/src/core/api`

## Purpose and Scope

The `core/api` module in the CodeWorm repository is designed to provide a centralized location for configuring and managing HTTP client instances used across the frontend application. This ensures consistent API interactions and simplifies dependency management.

## File Relationships

- **api.config.ts**: Contains configuration settings and setup logic for the main API client.
- **query.config.ts**: Configures specific query clients, possibly for different types of data retrieval or APIs with unique requirements.
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting configurations from `api.config` and `query.config`, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
- `apiClient`: A configured instance for general HTTP requests.
- `queryClient`: Configured instances for specific data queries or operations.

These exports allow developers to import and use these clients directly in their components or services without needing to manage configuration details themselves.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to make API calls or perform data queries. By importing `apiClient` for general requests and `queryClient` for specific operations, developers can ensure consistent and well-configured HTTP interactions throughout the application.
