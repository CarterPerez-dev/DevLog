## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `v1/frontend/src/core/i18n`

## Purpose and Scope

The `i18n` module in the `my-portfolio` repository is designed to handle internationalization (i18n) for the frontend application. It provides a centralized way to manage language changes and locale-specific content.

## File Relationships

- **index.ts**: This file serves as the entry point for the `i18n` module, exporting key functionalities such as `changeLanguage` and `i18n`. It acts as a bridge between internal implementation details in `i18n.config.ts` and external consumers.
  
- **i18n.config.ts**: Contains the core logic for managing language configurations and translations. This file is not directly exposed to end-users but provides essential functionality that is consumed by `index.ts`.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- `changeLanguage`: A function to switch the application's language.
- `i18n`: An object providing access to current locale settings and translation functions.

These exports allow developers to easily manage language changes and access localized content without needing to delve into the internal implementation details.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to:
- Change the application's language dynamically.
- Access or modify localization settings.
- Ensure consistent use of translations throughout the frontend codebase.
