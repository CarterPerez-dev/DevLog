## Module Overview

# frontend/src/api/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/api/types` module in the social-media-notes repository provides type definitions for various entities, specifically focusing on authentication (`auth.types.ts`) and video-related data (`video.types.ts`). This module ensures that developers have a clear understanding of the structure and expected types when interacting with API endpoints or handling related data.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, re-exporting all types defined in `auth.types.ts` and `video.types.ts`. This simplifies import statements for consumers.
- **auth.types.ts**: Contains TypeScript type definitions for authentication-related entities such as user credentials, tokens, etc.
- **video.types.ts**: Defines types for video data, including metadata, formats, and other relevant fields.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes all exported types from `auth.types.ts` and `video.types.ts`. Developers can import these types directly using the re-exports in `index.ts`.

```typescript
import { AuthUser, VideoMetadata } from 'frontend/src/api/types';
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to define or validate data structures for API requests and responses. For instance, when implementing authentication logic or handling video uploads and retrieval in the application.

This organization ensures that type definitions are centralized and easily accessible throughout the frontend codebase.
