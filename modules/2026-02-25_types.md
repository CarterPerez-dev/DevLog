## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `dashboard/frontend/src/api/types`

## Purpose and Scope

The `dashboard/frontend/src/api/types` package serves as a central repository for TypeScript type definitions used in the frontend API layer of the CodeWorm project. These types are essential for ensuring type safety, especially when dealing with data received from or sent to the backend.

## File Structure

- **`index.ts`**: This file acts as an entry point and reexports all types defined in `dashboard.types.ts`, making them easily accessible throughout the frontend codebase.
  
- **`dashboard.types.ts`**: Contains specific type definitions, such as interfaces for API responses, request payloads, and other data structures used within the dashboard module.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes reexported types from `dashboard.types.ts`. Developers can import these types directly using:

```typescript
import { DashboardType, AnotherType } from 'dashboard/frontend/src/api/types';
```

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this package when working on components or services that need to handle API data. For instance, when creating a new dashboard component, you might import types like `DashboardData` and `UserSettings` to ensure your code is type-safe and correctly structured.

By centralizing these types in one module, the package promotes consistency and maintainability across the frontend codebase.
