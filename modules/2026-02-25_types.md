## Module Overview

# frontend/src/types Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/types` module in the `angelamos-3d` repository provides type definitions for various components and utilities used across the application. This ensures consistency and clarity in data structures, making it easier to develop and maintain the codebase.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, re-exporting all types defined in `angela.types.ts`. This allows developers to import types directly from this module without needing to specify individual type files.
- **angela.types.ts**: Contains specific TypeScript type definitions for entities such as components, interfaces, and utility functions. These types are crucial for ensuring type safety throughout the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes all exported types defined in `angela.types.ts`. Developers can import these types directly using:
```typescript
import { ComponentType, InterfaceDefinition } from 'frontend/src/types';
```

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module whenever they need to define or use custom types within their components or utilities. By leveraging the well-defined types provided here, developers can ensure that their code adheres to a consistent and robust type structure, enhancing maintainability and reducing bugs related to data handling.

This modular approach not only simplifies the import process but also centralizes type management, making it easier for new contributors to understand and contribute to the project.
