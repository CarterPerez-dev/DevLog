## Module Overview

## Schemas Module Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `app/schemas` package is part of the backend component in the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection` repository, focusing on defining data models for various entities used within the application.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package and imports the public API from other files.
- **stats.py**: Contains schemas related to statistical data, such as performance metrics or aggregated threat indicators.
- **threats.py**: Defines schemas for different types of threats detected by the system, including their attributes and relationships.
- **websocket.py**: Manages schemas for WebSocket messages, ensuring consistent data formats during real-time communication.

### Public API Surface
The public API is primarily exposed through `__init__.py`, which imports key classes and functions from other files. For example:
```python
from .stats import StatsSchema
from .threats import ThreatSchema
from .websocket import WebSocketMessageSchema
```

### When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to define or validate data structures for various components of the application, such as threat detection models, statistical analyses, and real-time communication via WebSockets. This ensures consistency in data handling across different parts of the backend system.
