## Module Overview

## src/stripe_referral/adapters

### Purpose and Scope
The `src/stripe_referral/adapters` package serves as an adapter layer for various payout mechanisms, ensuring seamless integration with different financial services providers like Wise, Stripe Connect, and manual bank transfers. This package is part of the broader `stripe-referral` repository.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Acts as the entry point, importing all available adapters.
- **base.py**: Defines the abstract base class `PayoutAdapter`, which other adapter classes inherit from to ensure consistent behavior and required methods.
- **manual.py**: Implements the `ManualBankAdapter` for handling manual bank transfers.
- **stripe_connect.py**: Provides the `StripeConnectAdapter` for integrating with Stripe Connect.
- **wise.py**: Contains the implementation of the `WiseAdapter` for interfacing with Wise's financial services.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `PayoutAdapter`: An abstract base class defining methods that all adapter classes must implement.
- `WiseAdapter`, `ManualBankAdapter`, and `StripeConnectAdapter`: Concrete implementations of the `PayoutAdapter` interface, providing specific functionalities for each payout mechanism.

### When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when setting up or modifying the payout mechanisms within the application. By using these adapters, developers can easily switch between different payment providers without altering the core logic, promoting flexibility and ease of maintenance.
