## Module Overview

# frontend/src/lib/wakeword

## Purpose and Scope
The `wakeword` library is part of the frontend application's core audio processing utilities. It focuses on managing wake word detection, enabling the system to recognize specific keywords that trigger certain actions.

## File Relationships
- **WakeWordEngine.ts**: Contains the implementation logic for the Wake Word Engine, responsible for detecting predefined wake words in real-time audio streams.
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, re-exporting all public APIs from `WakeWordEngine.ts` to simplify import usage across the application.

## Public API Surface
The module exposes methods and classes related to initializing and managing the Wake Word Engine. Developers can interact with these APIs to integrate wake word detection into their components or services.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or enhance features that rely on recognizing specific keywords in audio inputs, such as voice-activated commands or interactive voice response systems within the application.
