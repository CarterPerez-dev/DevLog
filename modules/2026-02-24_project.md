- **dependencies.py**: Manages dependencies and provides utility functions.
- **routes.py**: Maps HTTP requests to the appropriate service methods.

### Public API Surface

- `Project`: The main model class.
- `ProjectRepository`: For database operations.
- `ProjectService`: Business logic for project management.
