## Module Overview

## src/telehook/adapters

### Purpose and Scope
The `src/telehook/adapters` package provides adapter implementations for integrating external services with the Telehook application. Specifically, it includes adapters for handling logging and web frameworks.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as an entry point for the package, importing and exposing the public API surface.
- **fastapi.py**: Contains the FastAPI adapter implementation, facilitating integration with the FastAPI framework.
- **logging_handler.py**: Implements a `TelehookLoggingHandler` class that can be used to route log messages to Telehook.

### Public API Surface
The public API is exposed via the `__all__` list in `__init__.py`. It includes:
- `TelehookLoggingHandler`: A logging handler for routing logs to Telehook.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to integrate logging or FastAPI services with Telehook. For example, to set up custom logging handlers in a FastAPI application, developers can import and configure the `TelehookLoggingHandler` from this package. Similarly, for integrating other web frameworks, the adapter pattern established here can be extended as needed.
