## Module Overview

# Middleware for Correlation ID Management

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/middleware` package provides middleware components designed to manage correlation IDs in a social media notes application. This is crucial for tracking requests across different services, enhancing traceability, and debugging.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the package, importing and exposing the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class.
- **correlation.py**: Contains the implementation of the `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, which is responsible for generating and managing correlation IDs within the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
```python
from backend.app.middleware import CorrelationIdMiddleware
```
This allows developers to easily integrate correlation ID management into their request handling logic.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to ensure that each request in the application is uniquely identifiable and traceable. This is particularly useful during distributed system interactions, where requests may pass through multiple services. By integrating `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, developers can maintain a consistent and clear trace of request flows throughout the application.
