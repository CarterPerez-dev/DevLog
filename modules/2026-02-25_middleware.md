## Module Overview

# fastapi/app/middleware

## Purpose and Scope

The `fastapi/app/middleware` package is designed to provide middleware for FastAPI applications, specifically focusing on managing correlation IDs for tracing requests across different services.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `middleware` module. It imports the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class from `correlation.py`, making it available to users.
  
- **correlation.py**: Contains the implementation of the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class, which is responsible for generating and propagating correlation IDs through FastAPI requests.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface includes:
- **CorrelationIdMiddleware**: A middleware class that manages correlation IDs. It can be added to a FastAPI application to trace requests across different services.

```python
from fastapi.app.middleware.correlation import CorrelationIdMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(CorrelationIdMiddleware)
```

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would use this module when they need to implement request tracing in their FastAPI applications. By adding the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` to their application, developers can ensure that correlation IDs are automatically managed and propagated across different services, facilitating easier debugging and monitoring of requests.

This package is particularly useful in microservices architectures where tracking requests through multiple services requires consistent and reliable ID management.
