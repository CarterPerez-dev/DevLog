## Module Overview

# `backend/app/api` Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `backend/app/api` package in the `encrypted-p2p-chat` project is designed to handle the application's core functionalities, including authentication, encryption of messages, management of chat rooms, and WebSocket communication. This package ensures secure and efficient data exchange between clients and the server.

## File Relationships

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the module and imports essential classes and functions from other files.
- **`auth.py`**: Manages user authentication processes, including login, registration, and session management.
- **`encryption.py`**: Implements encryption and decryption methods for secure message transmission.
- **`rooms.py`**: Handles the creation, deletion, and management of chat rooms, ensuring that only authorized users can join specific rooms.
- **`websocket.py`**: Manages WebSocket connections, facilitating real-time communication between clients and the server.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Authentication endpoints for user login and registration (`auth.py`).
- Encryption functions for secure message handling (`encryption.py`).
- Room management methods to create, join, and leave chat rooms (`rooms.py`).
- WebSocket connection handlers to manage real-time communication (`websocket.py`).

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when implementing or extending the backend functionalities of the encrypted P2P chat application. Specifically, they would use it for setting up secure authentication mechanisms, handling encryption requirements, managing chat rooms, and establishing WebSocket connections to ensure real-time communication.

This documentation provides an overview of how the `backend/app/api` package organizes code to support core functionalities in a secure and efficient manner.
