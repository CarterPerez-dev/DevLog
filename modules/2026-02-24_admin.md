## Module Overview

### Stacks/Fastapi-react/backend/app/admin

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `admin` package in the `stacks/fastapi-react/backend/app` directory is designed for managing administrative functionalities within the application. It primarily focuses on providing an API endpoint for administrative tasks, ensuring that only authorized users can access these features.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point and namespace for the `admin` package. It contains metadata such as copyright information.
- **routes.py**: Contains the implementation of FastAPI routes specific to administrative operations. These routes handle requests related to admin functionalities, ensuring they are securely managed.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface includes the definition and configuration of FastAPI routes in `routes.py`. Developers can interact with these routes via HTTP methods to perform administrative actions. The package does not expose any other public interfaces directly.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or extend administrative functionalities within their application. By defining and configuring the admin-specific FastAPI routes, developers can ensure that sensitive operations are securely handled and accessible only to authorized users.
