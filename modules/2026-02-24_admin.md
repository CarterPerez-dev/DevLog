## Module Overview

# backends/fastapi/app/admin

## Purpose and Scope
The `backends/fastapi/app/admin` package is part of the fullstack-template repository, specifically designed for managing administrative tasks within the application using FastAPI. This package encapsulates functionalities related to administrative operations, ensuring a clear separation from other components.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point and namespace for this module. It provides a clean interface by importing key classes and functions defined in `routes.py`.
- **routes.py**: Contains the core logic for defining FastAPI routes related to administrative tasks, such as user management, settings configuration, etc.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is primarily exposed through the `__init__.py` file. Developers can interact with this package by importing specific classes and functions from `routes.py`. For example:
```python
from backends.fastapi.app.admin import admin_router

app.include_router(admin_router)
```

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to implement or extend administrative functionalities within the application. This could include setting up custom endpoints for managing users, roles, and other sensitive data. The package is particularly useful during development and testing phases where detailed control over the application's backend operations is required.

By organizing code in this manner, the `backends/fastapi/app/admin` module promotes a modular and maintainable architecture, making it easier to manage complex administrative tasks within the FastAPI framework.
