## Module Overview

### red-recon/src/shared/components/ui

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package contains reusable UI components designed for consistent styling and functionality across the `red-recon` application. It includes basic elements like buttons, cards, inputs, and custom backgrounds.

**File Relationships:**
- **Button.tsx:** A customizable button component with various props to control its appearance.
- **Card.tsx:** A container component that provides a styled card layout for displaying content.
- **DottedBackground.tsx:** A background component with a dotted pattern for visual interest.
- **Input.tsx and PasswordInput.tsx:** Input fields, with `PasswordInput` providing password-specific styling and behavior.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes exports of all components from the individual files. Developers can import any of these components directly using the names exported in `index.ts`.

```typescript
import { Button, Card, DottedBackground, Input, PasswordInput } from 'red-recon/src/shared/components/ui';
```

**When to Use:**
Developers should use this module when they need consistent UI elements across their application. It is particularly useful for quickly implementing buttons, inputs, and cards with predefined styles, ensuring a uniform look and feel throughout the app.
