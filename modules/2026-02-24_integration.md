## Module Overview

# tests/integration

## Purpose and Scope

The `tests/integration` package in the `stripe-referral` repository is designed for integration testing, ensuring that components of the application work together as expected. This package contains test cases that simulate real-world interactions between different parts of the system.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the package and can include any initialization code or configuration necessary for running tests.
- **test_referral_service.py**: Contains specific integration tests focused on the `referral_service` module. These tests verify that the referral service functions correctly in a simulated environment.

## Public API Surface

The public API surface of this package is minimal, primarily consisting of test fixtures and test cases defined within `test_referral_service.py`. Developers do not directly interact with these files; instead, they are run automatically as part of the testing suite.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would use this module during development or continuous integration pipelines to ensure that changes in the `referral_service` do not break existing functionality. The tests here help maintain a robust and reliable system by validating interactions between different components under various scenarios.
