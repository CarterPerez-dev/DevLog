## Module Overview

# v1/backend/tests/integration

## Purpose and Scope
The `v1/backend/tests/integration` package contains integration tests for various components of the backend system in the `my-portfolio` repository. These tests are designed to ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected.

## File Relationships
Each `.py` file within this directory corresponds to a specific module or feature being tested:
- **test_admin.py**: Tests functionalities related to admin users.
- **test_auth.py**: Validates authentication mechanisms.
- **test_blogs.py**: Ensures blog-related operations are correct.
- **test_certifications.py**: Checks certification handling.
- **test_experiences.py**: Verifies experience management features.
- **test_health.py**: Tests health checks and system status endpoints.
- **test_projects.py**: Ensures project-related functionalities are working properly.
- **test_users.py**: Validates user-related operations.

The `__init__.py` file is a placeholder that allows this directory to be imported as a module, making it easier to run all integration tests together using a single entry point.

## Public API Surface
This package does not expose any public APIs directly. Instead, its primary purpose is to provide comprehensive integration test coverage for the backend components. Developers can use these tests by running them via a testing framework like `pytest`.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to ensure that different parts of the backend system are functioning correctly together. These tests are run during development and continuous integration processes to catch issues early in the development cycle.

By organizing tests by functionality, developers can easily target specific areas for testing or use all tests collectively to validate the entire backend stack.
