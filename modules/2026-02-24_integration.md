## Module Overview

### CarterOS-Server/tests/integration

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `CarterOS-Server/tests/integration` package is designed to contain integration tests for various components of the CarterOS server application. These tests are crucial for ensuring that different parts of the system work together as expected.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point and initializes the test suite.
- **test_auth.py**: Contains unit and integration tests related to authentication mechanisms.
- **test_health.py**: Focuses on testing the health endpoints and their responses.
- **test_users.py**: Tests functionalities related to user management, including registration, login, and profile updates.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface is primarily internal to this package. The `__init__.py` file ensures that all test modules are imported when this package is loaded. There are no external functions or classes exposed; the focus is on running comprehensive tests for integration purposes.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package during the testing phase to validate the functionality of CarterOS server components. By executing these tests, developers can ensure that authentication, health checks, and user management functionalities are working correctly in an integrated environment. This is particularly useful before deploying new features or making significant changes to the system.
