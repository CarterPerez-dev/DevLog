## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/monitoring

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains models related to monitoring system logs for administrative purposes, specifically focusing on AI usage and HTTP request logs.

## File Relationships
- **AIUsageLog.py**: Manages the logging of AI-related activities. This includes tracking when and how AI services are used within the application.
- **RequestLog.py**: Handles the logging of all incoming HTTP requests to the backend API. It captures details such as request time, method, path, and user information.

## Public API Surface
The public API consists of two classes:
- `AIUsageLog`: Provides methods for recording AI usage logs.
- `RequestLog`: Offers functionality to log detailed information about HTTP requests.

### __init__.py
This file serves as the entry point for importing the monitoring models. It imports and exposes both `AIUsageLog` and `RequestLog` classes, making them available under the package namespace.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or extend logging functionality in the backend API. Specifically, it is useful for tracking AI activities and HTTP requests, which can be crucial for debugging, performance monitoring, and compliance purposes.
