## Module Overview

# Core Detection Module

## Purpose and Scope
The `app/core/detection` package is part of the backend for an advanced AI threat detection system within the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection` project. This package focuses on defining core functionalities related to threat detection rules, ensuring that these rules are easily maintainable and extensible.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `detection` module. It initializes any necessary components or configurations required by the sub-modules.
- **rules.py**: Contains the implementation of various threat detection rules, which are essential for identifying potential threats in real-time data streams.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- Functions and classes defined in `rules.py`. These include methods such as `detect_threat`, `evaluate_rule`, and custom rule definitions.
- Type hints and decorators used to ensure robustness and clarity of the codebase. For example, a function might be annotated with `@validate_input` to enforce input validation.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or modify threat detection rules within the AI threat detection system. It is also useful for testing and debugging purposes, as it provides clear interfaces for evaluating different types of threats based on predefined rules.
