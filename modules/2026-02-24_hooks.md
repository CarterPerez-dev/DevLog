## Module Overview

### CarterOS-Client/src/core/sys/auth/hooks Module Documentation

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `CarterOS-Client/src/core/sys/auth/hooks` package is designed to provide reusable authentication hooks for managing user sessions, roles, and administrative actions within the application. This ensures a consistent and secure way of handling authentication logic across different components.

**File Relationships:**
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, exporting all public hooks from other files.
- **useAuth.ts**: Provides generic authentication-related hooks for logging in/out, checking session status, etc.
- **useUsers.ts**: Offers hooks to manage user data, such as fetching and updating user profiles.
- **useAdmin.ts**: Specializes in administrative actions, providing hooks that require higher-level permissions.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes:
- `useAuth`: General authentication hooks for session management.
- `useUsers`: Hooks for handling user-related operations.
- `useAdmin`: Admin-specific hooks with enhanced permissions checks.

**When to Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or integrate authentication and authorization logic into their components. It is particularly useful in scenarios where consistent, secure authentication practices are required across multiple parts of the application.
