## Module Overview

# frontend/src/api/hooks

## Purpose and Scope

This package provides reusable React hooks for handling common API interactions in the `frontend` application, specifically focusing on authentication, file uploads, client configuration, bulk data operations, and search functionalities.

## File Relationships

- **index.ts**: Serves as an export point for all hooks defined within this module.
- **useAuth.ts**: Manages user authentication logic.
- **useBulkUpload.ts**: Handles bulk upload operations.
- **useClientConfig.ts**: Provides configuration settings related to the client environment.
- **useSearch.ts**: Facilitates search functionalities across various components.
- **useUpload.ts**: Offers file upload capabilities.

## Public API Surface

Developers can import and use these hooks directly in their React components. The public API includes:

```typescript
import { useAuth, useBulkUpload, useClientConfig, useSearch, useUpload } from 'frontend/src/api/hooks';
```

Each hook is designed to be stateless and composable within the application.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or enhance functionalities related to user authentication, file uploads, client-specific configurations, bulk data operations, and search features in their React components.
