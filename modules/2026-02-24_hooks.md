## Module Overview

### red-recon/src/shared/hooks Module Documentation

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `red-recon/src/shared/hooks` package provides reusable React hooks for common functionalities such as state management, biometric authentication, notifications, online status tracking, and session handling in the iOS-test repository.

**File Relationships:**
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point exporting all individual hooks.
- **useAppState.ts**: Manages application-wide state.
- **useBiometrics.ts**: Provides access to device biometric features like fingerprint or face recognition.
- **useBiometricAuth.ts**: Facilitates authentication using biometric data.
- **useNotifications.ts**: Handles push notifications and local notifications.
- **useOnlineManager.ts**: Tracks the network connection status of the application.
- **useSession.ts**: Manages user session state, including login and logout functionalities.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes a suite of hooks that can be imported directly from `src/shared/hooks`. Developers have access to state management (`useAppState`), biometric authentication (`useBiometricAuth`), notifications handling (`useNotifications`), online status tracking (`useOnlineManager`), and session management (`useSession`).

**When to Use:**
This module is essential for developers working on components that require these common functionalities. By leveraging the hooks provided, developers can ensure consistent and reliable behavior across different parts of the application without duplicating code.
