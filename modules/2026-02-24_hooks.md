## Module Overview

# v1/frontend/src/api/hooks Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `v1/frontend/src/api/hooks` package in the `my-portfolio` repository is designed to provide reusable React hooks for fetching data from various APIs, primarily related to user authentication, admin functionalities, and portfolio content such as blogs, certifications, experiences, projects, and search results.

## File Relationships
Each file within this module defines a specific hook:
- **useAuth.ts**: Manages authentication-related API calls.
- **useAdmin.ts**: Handles administrative tasks and data retrieval.
- **useBlogs.ts**, **useCertifications.ts**, **useExperiences.ts**, **useProjects.ts**, and **useSearch.ts**: Provide hooks for fetching and managing different types of user-generated content.

`index.ts` serves as the entry point, exporting all individual hooks to be easily imported by components that need them.

## Public API Surface
The public API consists of eight hooks:
- `useAuth`
- `useAdmin`
- `useBlogs`
- `useCertifications`
- `useExperiences`
- `useProjects`
- `useSearch`
- `useUsers`

These hooks abstract away the complexity of making API calls, providing clean interfaces for fetching and handling data.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when building components that require access to user authentication, admin functionalities, or any form of dynamic content (blogs, certifications, etc.) in their portfolio application. By importing these hooks, developers can easily integrate data fetching into their React components without managing the API calls themselves.
