## Module Overview

# backend/qa/community_qa

## Purpose and Scope
The `community_qa` package is part of CertGames-Core's testing infrastructure, specifically designed for generating and managing test data related to the community domain. This includes fixtures and test data that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of tests.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the `community_qa` package, providing a namespace for its contents.
- **conftest.py**: Contains configuration settings and shared fixtures used across multiple test modules within this package. It initializes necessary resources and data structures required for testing.

## Public API Surface
The public API is primarily defined through fixtures in `conftest.py`. These fixtures provide mock community-related data that can be used in various test scenarios, ensuring consistent and predictable test environments.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when writing tests that require specific community-related data. By leveraging the fixtures provided, they can ensure that their tests are isolated and reliable, without relying on external or mutable state.
