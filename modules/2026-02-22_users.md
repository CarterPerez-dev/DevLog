## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/users

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains models for managing administrative users within the `backend` application, specifically focusing on user management functionalities.

## File Relationships
- **AdminUser.py**: Defines the `AdminUser` model class, which represents an administrative user in the system. This class likely includes fields specific to admin roles and methods for interacting with these users.
  
- **UserManagement.py**: Contains the `UserManagement` class, responsible for handling operations related to user management such as creating, updating, and deleting users. It interacts with the `AdminUser` model.

- **__init__.py**: Serves as an entry point for this package, exposing the public API surface by importing and exporting the necessary classes (`AdminUser`, `UserManagement`).

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- **AdminUser**: A class representing administrative users.
- **UserManagement**: A class providing methods to manage user data.

```python
from backend.api.admin.models.users import AdminUser, UserManagement

# Example usage
admin_user = AdminUser(username="admin", email="admin@example.com")
user_management = UserManagement()
user_management.create_user(admin_user)
```

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage administrative users within the backend application. This includes creating, updating, or deleting admin users through the `UserManagement` class.
