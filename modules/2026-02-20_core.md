## Module Overview

# app/core Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `app/core` package serves as the foundational core of the backend application for the AI Threat Detection project, providing essential utilities and services that are critical to the overall functionality.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package and can be used to define global configurations or setup functions.
- **redis_manager.py**: Manages interactions with Redis, a key-value store often used for caching and real-time data sharing. It provides a robust interface for managing cache operations, ensuring efficient and reliable data access.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
- `RedisManager` class from `redis_manager.py`, which offers methods like `connect()`, `set_key()`, and `get_key()` to interact with Redis.
- Any global configurations or setup functions defined in the `__init__.py`.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to integrate caching mechanisms, real-time data updates, or any operations that require efficient storage and retrieval of data. The `RedisManager` class provides a clean and Pythonic interface for managing Redis interactions, making it easier to manage cache operations within the application.

This structure ensures that core functionalities are encapsulated in a way that is both modular and maintainable, facilitating easy integration with other parts of the backend application.
