## Module Overview

# v1/frontend/src/core/lib Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `v1/frontend/src/core/lib` package is a core library for managing state in the frontend of the `my-portfolio` repository. It encapsulates essential components like authentication, user interface states, and language settings.

## File Relationships

- **auth.form.store.ts**: Manages form-related state during authentication processes.
- **auth.store.ts**: Handles global authentication state, including login, logout, and session management.
- **component.store.ts**: Stores state related to UI components, ensuring consistent state across the application.
- **language.store.ts**: Manages language preferences for localization purposes.

## Public API Surface

The `index.ts` file exports all public APIs from the sub-modules:
```typescript
export * from './auth.form.store'
export * from './auth.store'
export * from './language.store'
```

This allows developers to import and use these modules directly, providing a clean and modular interface.

## When to Use

Developers would interact with this package when they need to manage authentication states, component-specific states, or language preferences in their frontend application. This package is particularly useful for maintaining consistent state management across different parts of the application.
