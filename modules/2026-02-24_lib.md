## Module Overview

# react-scss/src/core/lib

## Purpose and Scope
The `react-scss/src/core/lib` package serves as a foundational library for managing state and UI configurations in React applications using SCSS. It encapsulates core functionalities that are essential for maintaining consistency across the application's components.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: This file acts as an entry point, re-exporting all symbols from `shell.ui.store`. It ensures that developers can import necessary utilities or state management logic directly without needing to navigate through sub-modules.
- **shell.ui.store.ts**: Contains the core state management and UI configuration logic. It provides a centralized store for managing application-wide states related to user interface elements.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes re-exported types, interfaces, and functions from `shell.ui.store`. Developers can import these directly in their components or other modules to access the state management utilities and configurations.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage global states related to UI elements across different parts of a React application. By leveraging the re-exports from `shell.ui.store`, developers can ensure consistent and maintainable state handling, enhancing the overall application's reliability and scalability.
