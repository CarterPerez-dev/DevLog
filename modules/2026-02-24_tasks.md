## Module Overview

### backend/core/tasks

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `backend/core/tasks` package provides the infrastructure for managing task queues within the `vuemantics` repository. This includes setting up and interacting with a message broker to facilitate asynchronous task execution.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the package, importing and exposing the `broker` object.
- **broker.py**: Contains the implementation details for interfacing with the message broker, handling task submission, and managing worker processes.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API is exposed via the `__all__` list in `__init__.py`, which includes only one item:
- `broker`: An instance of a message broker that can be used to submit tasks asynchronously. This object provides methods for publishing tasks and subscribing workers, enabling seamless integration with other parts of the application.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this package when they need to schedule or execute background tasks in their applications. By using the `broker` instance, developers can easily submit tasks that will be processed asynchronously, improving the responsiveness and efficiency of their services.
