## Module Overview

## fastapi/app/cycle Documentation

### Purpose and Scope
The `fastapi/app/cycle` package provides an API for managing menstrual cycle data, including status updates, phase information, calendar views, and pattern recognition.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point, importing and exporting key components from sub-modules.
- **dependencies.py**: Contains dependency injection mechanisms like `CycleServiceDep` and a factory function `get_cycle_service`.
- **routes.py**: Defines API endpoints for interacting with cycle data.
- **schemas.py**: Houses Pydantic models such as `CycleStatus`, `PhaseInfo`, `CalendarDay`, `CalendarMonth`, `CyclePattern`, and `PHASE_TIPS`.
- **service.py**: Implements business logic related to cycle management.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `CycleService`: The main service class for managing cycle data.
- `CycleStatus`, `PhaseInfo`, `CalendarDay`, `CalendarMonth`, `CyclePattern`, and `PHASE_TIPS`: Data models for representing various aspects of menstrual cycles.
- `CycleServiceDep` and `get_cycle_service`: Dependency injection tools.
- `router`: The API router for handling HTTP requests.

### When to Use
Developers would use this module when building or extending an application that requires menstrual cycle data management, such as tracking phases, patterns, and calendar views. This package is particularly useful in health-related applications where user data privacy and accuracy are critical.
