## Module Overview

# ml

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `ml` package is part of the backend for an AI threat detection system, focusing on machine learning components such as autoencoders and classifiers.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.
- **autoencoder.py**: Contains classes and functions related to training and using autoencoders for anomaly detection.
- **export_onnx.py**: Exports trained models in ONNX format for deployment or further processing.
- **scaler.py**: Implements data scaling utilities used by both autoencoders and classifiers.
- **train_autoencoder.py**: Script for training the autoencoder model.
- **train_classifiers.py**: Script for training various classifier models.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API includes classes, functions, and methods from `autoencoder.py` and `scaler.py`. Developers can interact with these to train and use autoencoders and scaling utilities. The ONNX export functionality is also exposed via this package.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this module when they need to integrate machine learning components into the threat detection system, particularly for training models or preparing them for deployment in an ONNX format.
