## Module Overview

## backend/core/websocket

### Purpose and Scope
This package provides WebSocket infrastructure for real-time upload progress tracking in the `vuemantics` repository, enabling seamless communication between clients and servers during file uploads.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point, importing and exporting classes from other modules.
- **manager.py**: Manages WebSocket connections and handles client interactions.
- **messages.py**: Defines message types for different stages of upload processes.
- **publisher.py**: Implements a publisher to broadcast upload progress updates.

### Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `ConnectionManager`: Manages WebSocket connections.
- `get_manager()`: Returns the singleton instance of `ConnectionManager`.
- Various message classes like `ProcessingStage`, `ServerMessage`, and specific update types such as `UploadProgressUpdate` and `FileProgressUpdate`.
- `UploadProgressPublisher`: Publishes upload progress updates.
- `get_publisher()` and `init_publisher()`: Utility functions for initializing the publisher.

### When to Use
Developers would interact with this package when implementing real-time upload tracking features in their applications. This includes setting up WebSocket connections, handling different stages of file uploads, and broadcasting progress updates to clients.
