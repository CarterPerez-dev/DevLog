## Module Overview

# services

## Purpose and Scope
The `services` package in the `backend/app` directory of the `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection` repository is designed to encapsulate core functionalities related to threat detection and statistical analysis for cybersecurity applications.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `services` module. It imports and initializes the services defined in other files.
- **stats_service.py**: Contains classes and functions focused on statistical analysis, providing methods to process and analyze data relevant to threat detection.
- **threat_service.py**: Implements core logic for identifying and managing threats based on the processed data from `stats_service`.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Classes and functions defined in both `stats_service` and `threat_service`.
- Exports of key methods and classes are made available via the `__init__.py`, allowing seamless integration with other parts of the application.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when they need to implement or integrate threat detection functionalities into their cybersecurity applications. The services provided here can be instantiated and used directly, making it easy to leverage statistical analysis and threat identification capabilities within the broader backend architecture.
