## Module Overview

### Documentation for `stacks/fastapi-react/backend/tests/integration`

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package contains integration tests for various components of the backend application, ensuring that different parts of the system work together as expected. The tests cover administrative functions, authentication mechanisms, user management, and health checks.

**File Relationships:**
- **`__init__.py`:** This file is a placeholder to indicate that this directory is a Python package.
- **`test_admin.py`:** Contains unit tests for administrative functionalities.
- **`test_auth.py`:** Includes tests for authentication logic.
- **`test_health.py`:** Tests the health check endpoints and their responses.
- **`test_users.py`:** Covers user-related operations, such as registration, login, and profile management.

**Public API Surface:**
While this package is primarily used internally for testing purposes, it indirectly exposes its test functions through the `pytest` framework. Developers can run these tests to ensure that the backend components are functioning correctly.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this module during development and continuous integration to verify that the backend services interact correctly with each other. Running the integration tests helps catch issues early in the development cycle, ensuring a robust application.
