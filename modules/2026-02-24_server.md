## Module Overview

# Angela-TTS/server

## Purpose and Scope
The `Angela-TTS/server` package serves as the core server component of the Angela TTS system, responsible for handling HTTP requests and managing the application's state.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file acts as the entry point for the module. It is automatically executed when the package is imported.
- **config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the server, such as database connections and API keys.
- **routes.py**: Defines all the HTTP routes and their corresponding handlers, facilitating interaction with the server's services.
- **run.py**: A script used to start the server. It imports necessary modules and initializes the application.

## Public API Surface
The public API is primarily exposed through `routes.py`. Developers can interact with this package by defining new routes or modifying existing ones in `routes.py` to extend functionality. Additionally, configuration settings can be adjusted via `config.py`.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module when they need to add new features to the server, such as implementing new endpoints or altering existing ones. They might also modify configurations in `config.py` to tailor the server's behavior to specific needs.

This structure ensures that the package is modular and easy to extend while maintaining clear separation of concerns among its components.
