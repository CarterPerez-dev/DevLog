## Module Overview

# Angela-Wake/server Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `Angela-Wake/server` package is designed to manage the server-side logic of an application, including configuration settings, route definitions, and the main entry point for running the server.

## File Relationships

- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the initialization module for the package. It can contain any necessary imports or setup code that needs to be executed when the package is imported.
  
- **config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the application, such as database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific parameters.

- **routes.py**: Defines all the routes (URL endpoints) of the web application. It uses Flask's routing mechanisms to map URLs to functions that handle requests.

- **run.py**: The main entry point for starting the server. It imports necessary modules and initializes the application before running it.

## Public API Surface

The public API primarily includes:
- Configuration settings from `config.py`
- Route definitions from `routes.py`

Developers can interact with this package by importing specific configurations or routes in their own code, or by running the application via `run.py` to start the server.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

A developer would use this module when setting up and configuring an application's server-side logic. They might import configuration settings from `config.py` to set up database connections or API keys in other parts of their codebase. For running the application, they can execute `run.py`, which sets everything up and starts the server.
