## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/qa/monitoring_unit

## Purpose and Scope
This package contains models for quality assurance (QA) related to monitoring units within the admin interface of the CertGames-Core application. Specifically, it focuses on logging AI usage and requests.

## File Relationships
- **`__init__.py`**: This file serves as the initialization script for the `qa/monitoring_unit` package. It is automatically executed when any module in this package is imported.
- **`qa_ai_usage_log_models.py`**: Contains models related to logging AI usage within monitoring units, including fields such as timestamp, user ID, and AI action details.
- **`qa_request_log_models.py`**: Houses models for logging requests made through the monitoring unit interface, with fields like request type, status, and response time.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- Models defined in `qa_ai_usage_log_models.py` and `qa_request_log_models.py`.
- Any methods or properties exposed by these models that are intended to be used by other parts of the application.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement, test, or modify logging mechanisms for AI usage and requests in the admin interface. This is particularly useful during development and QA phases to ensure proper tracking and debugging of system behavior.
