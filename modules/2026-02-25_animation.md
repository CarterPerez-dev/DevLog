## Module Overview

# frontend/src/lib/animation

## Purpose and Scope
The `frontend/src/lib/animation` package is designed to manage and control animations within the application, particularly focusing on integrating animations from Mixamo, a popular 3D character animation service.

## File Relationships
- **AnimationController.ts**: Manages the state of animations, providing methods to start, stop, and update animations.
- **AnimationManager.ts**: Acts as the central hub for managing all animations. It initializes and coordinates with `AnimationController` instances.
- **index.ts**: Exports public API components, ensuring a clean interface for other modules.
- **loadMixamoAnimation.ts**: Handles the loading of animations from Mixamo, providing necessary mappings and configurations.
- **mixamoVRMRigMap.ts**: Contains mappings between VRM rig structures and Mixamo animations, facilitating seamless integration.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `AnimationController`: Manages individual animation states.
- `AnimationState`: Defines the state of an animation (e.g., playing, paused).
- `loadMixamoAnimation`: Function to load animations from Mixamo.
- `mixamoVRMRigMap`: Mappings for VRM rig structures.

## When to Use
Developers would interact with this module when they need to implement or manage character animations within the application. This includes initializing and controlling animations, particularly those imported from external services like Mixamo.
