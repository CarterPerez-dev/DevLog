## Module Overview

# backend/api/admin/models/qa/security_unit

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/admin/models/qa/security_unit` package is designed for quality assurance (QA) testing of security-related models in the admin interface. It contains various modules that define and test different aspects of security models, ensuring they function correctly.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for this package.
- **qa_active_token_count_models.py**, **qa_data_retention_models.py**, **qa_ip_blocklist_models.py**, **qa_rate_limit_models.py**, **qa_security_event_models.py**, and **qa_token_blocklist_models.py**: Each of these files contains specific QA models related to different security features. They are designed to be modular, allowing for targeted testing of individual components.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface includes the definitions and test cases within each file. Developers can interact with this package by importing specific modules or using the defined classes and functions directly in their tests.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module during the QA phase to ensure that security-related models are functioning as expected. It is particularly useful for testing features such as token management, IP blocklisting, rate limiting, data retention policies, and security event logging. Developers can import specific modules or classes from these files to run targeted tests or integrate them into a broader test suite.

This package follows Pythonic patterns with clear file organization and uses type hints and context managers where appropriate for robust testing.
