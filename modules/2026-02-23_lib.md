## Module Overview

# Module Documentation: `core/lib`

## Purpose and Scope

The `core/lib` package in the `stacks/go-react/frontend/src` directory is designed to encapsulate core functionalities that are shared across different parts of the application, particularly focusing on authentication and user interface states. This package ensures a consistent and modular approach to managing these critical aspects.

## File Relationships

- **auth.form.store.ts**: Manages state related to form submissions during authentication processes.
- **auth.store.ts**: Handles general authentication-related state such as login, logout, and session management.
- **shell.ui.store.ts**: Controls the UI state of the application shell, including navigation and layout configurations.

`index.ts` serves as an entry point for this module, exporting all functionalities from its sub-files. This design promotes reusability and maintainability by centralizing related functionality in a single import statement.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Authentication-related state management (`auth.store`)
- Form submission handling during authentication processes (`auth.form.store`)
- UI state for the application shell (`shell.ui.store`)

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this module when they need to manage or access core functionalities such as user authentication and shell UI states. For instance, a developer working on a feature that requires form-based authentication would import `auth.form.store`, while another might use `auth.store` for session management across different components.
