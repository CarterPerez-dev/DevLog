## Module Overview

# Core Library Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `frontends/react-scss/src/core/lib` module is part of the `fullstack-template` repository, designed to provide foundational components for managing state across different parts of the application. Specifically, it focuses on authentication-related state management.

## File Relationships

- **auth.form.store.ts**: Manages form-based authentication states and actions.
- **auth.store.ts**: Handles general authentication states such as login and logout.
- **shell.ui.store.ts**: Controls UI-related states for the shell component, ensuring consistent user interface behavior.
- **index.ts**: Acts as an entry point, exporting all functionalities from the other files.

## Public API Surface

The public API includes:
- Authentication state management (`auth.form.store`, `auth.store`)
- Shell UI state management (`shell.ui.store`)

Developers can import these modules directly using the exports in `index.ts`.

## When to Use This Module

This module is essential for developers working on authentication and UI states within the application. It provides a centralized place for managing and accessing authentication-related data, ensuring consistency across different parts of the frontend. Developers should use this module whenever they need to interact with or manage authentication states in their components.
