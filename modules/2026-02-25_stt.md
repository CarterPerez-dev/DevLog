## Module Overview

# backend/app/stt Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/app/stt` package is designed to handle Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities within the application, including routing requests, defining schemas for data validation, and managing service interactions.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point of the package. It imports the router and includes it in the public API surface.
- **router.py**: Contains the routing logic for STT endpoints, facilitating communication between the application's frontend and backend services.
- **schemas.py**: Defines Pydantic schemas to validate input data for STT operations, ensuring consistency and correctness of incoming requests.
- **service.py**: Implements the core functionality for STT processing, including interaction with external APIs or services.

## Public API Surface
The public API is exposed through `__all__` in `__init__.py`, which includes only the `router`. Developers can import and use the router to define and manage STT-related endpoints.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when setting up or modifying STT-related functionalities within their application. Specifically, they would use it to configure routes for handling speech-to-text requests, ensuring that data is properly validated before processing, and integrating the service layer to perform actual STT operations.

This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
