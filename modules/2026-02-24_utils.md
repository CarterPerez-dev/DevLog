## Module Overview

# v1/frontend/src/core/utils Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope

The `v1/frontend/src/core/utils` package is designed to provide utility functions that are essential for various frontend tasks in the `my-portfolio` repository. This package focuses on generic helper functions, ensuring code reusability across different components.

## File Relationships

- **extract.headings.ts**: Contains logic for extracting headings from a given HTML string.
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point, exporting all public APIs defined in the other files.
- **useOnClickOutside.ts**: Provides a custom React hook to handle events where a component should close when clicked outside of it.

## Public API Surface

The module exposes two main functions:
1. `extractHeadings`: A utility function for parsing and extracting headings from an HTML string.
2. `useOnClickOutside`: A React hook that allows components to detect clicks outside their boundaries, useful for modal implementations or dropdowns.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module

Developers would use this module when they need to:
- Parse and manipulate HTML content in the frontend.
- Implement interactive UI elements like modals or dropdown menus by handling click events outside these components.
