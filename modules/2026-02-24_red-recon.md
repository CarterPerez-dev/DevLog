## Module Overview

# red-recon Module Documentation

## Purpose and Scope
The `red-recon` module is part of the `ios-test` repository, designed to serve as the main entry point for an Expo-based React Native application. It organizes components and configurations necessary for running the app.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as the entry point for the application, registering the root component with Expo.
- **App.tsx**: Contains the main UI logic of the application.
- **expo-env.d.ts**: Declares TypeScript types for environment variables used in the project.
- **tamagui.config.ts**: Configures Tamagui, a CSS-in-JS library, to customize and style components.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface is minimal, focusing on the `registerRootComponent` call that initializes the app. Developers interact with this module by ensuring their main application logic (in `App.tsx`) is correctly structured and registered.

## When to Use This Module
Developers would use this module when setting up or modifying the entry point of an Expo-based React Native project, particularly when integrating Tamagui for styling and layout management.
