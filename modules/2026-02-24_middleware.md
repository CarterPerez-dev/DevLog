## Module Overview

### Middleware for Correlation IDs in FastAPI Applications

**Purpose and Scope:**
The `middleware` package within the `backend/app` directory is designed to provide a consistent mechanism for tracking requests through a FastAPI application using correlation IDs. This helps in logging, debugging, and tracing request flows across multiple services.

**File Relationships:**
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for the middleware module. It imports and exposes the `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class.
- **correlation.py**: Contains the implementation of the `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, which is responsible for generating and propagating correlation IDs throughout the request lifecycle.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface includes a single class:
```python
from .correlation import CorrelationIdMiddleware

__all__ = [
    "CorrelationIdMiddleware",
]
```
`CorrelationIdMiddleware` is designed to be registered with a FastAPI application, enabling it to intercept and modify requests and responses.

**When to Use:**
Developers would use this module when they need to implement request tracing in their FastAPI applications. By registering `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, developers can ensure that every request has a unique identifier, facilitating easier debugging and logging across the application stack.

This middleware is particularly useful in microservices architectures where requests might traverse multiple services, making it challenging to trace individual requests without a consistent identifier.
