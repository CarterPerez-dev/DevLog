## Module Overview

## Middleware for Correlation IDs

### Purpose and Scope
The `v1/backend/app/middleware` package is designed to provide middleware components that facilitate the tracking of request correlation IDs in a Python web application. This helps in tracing requests through various layers of an application, making debugging and logging more effective.

### File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: Serves as the entry point for this module. It imports `CorrelationIdMiddleware` from `correlation.py`, which is the only file within this package.
- **correlation.py**: Contains the implementation of `CorrelationIdMiddleware`. This class is responsible for generating and propagating correlation IDs across different parts of the application.

### Public API Surface
The public API surface includes:
```python
from v1.backend.app.middleware import CorrelationIdMiddleware
```
This allows developers to easily integrate request correlation functionality into their web applications. The `CorrelationIdMiddleware` class provides methods for setting and retrieving correlation IDs, ensuring consistent tracking across requests.

### When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would use this module in scenarios where they need to track the flow of requests through an application, such as during debugging or when implementing logging mechanisms that require context-aware information. By integrating `CorrelationIdMiddleware`, developers can ensure that each request has a unique identifier, facilitating easier traceability and analysis.
