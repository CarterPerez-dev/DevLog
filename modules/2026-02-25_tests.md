## Module Overview

### Documentation for `PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/tests`

**Purpose and Scope:**
This package contains comprehensive test suites for various components of the AI threat detection backend system, ensuring robust functionality and reliability.

**File Relationships:**
- **`__init__.py`:** Initializes the tests package.
- **`conftest.py`:** Contains shared fixtures and setup configurations used across multiple test files.
- **Test Files:** Each file (`test_api`, `test_autoencoder`, etc.) focuses on testing a specific module or functionality, such as API endpoints, machine learning models, data preprocessing steps, and more.

**Public API Surface:**
The public API surface is primarily internal to the backend system. However, developers can interact with it indirectly by running tests via CI/CD pipelines or manually executing test scripts for debugging purposes.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would use this package when they need to verify the correctness and robustness of the AI threat detection backend components during development and integration phases. It is also useful for maintaining system integrity as new features are added or existing functionalities evolve.
