## Module Overview

### Module Documentation: PROJECTS/advanced/ai-threat-detection/backend/tests

**Purpose & Scope:**
This package contains comprehensive test modules for the AI Threat Detection backend system, ensuring robustness and reliability of the application's components.

**File Relationships:**
- **`__init__.py`:** Initializes the testing module.
- **`conftest.py`:** Centralizes fixtures and configurations used across multiple tests.
- **`test_*` Files:** Individual test modules covering various aspects:
  - `api.py`: Tests for API endpoints.
  - `autoencoder.py`: Tests for autoencoder models.
  - `config_ml.py`: Tests related to machine learning configuration.
  - `detection.py`: Detection algorithms and their functionalities.
  - `features.py`: Feature extraction methods.
  - `geoip.py`: GeoIP processing tests.
  - `integration.py`: Integration tests between different components.
  - `parsers.py`: Data parsing and validation tests.
  - `pipeline.py`: End-to-end pipeline testing.
  - `scaler.py`: Tests for data scaling mechanisms.

**Public API Surface:**
While this package does not expose public APIs directly, it provides essential test fixtures and functions that are indirectly used by developers through the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the backend system's stability.

**When a Developer Would Use This Module:**
Developers would interact with this module primarily during development and testing phases. It is crucial for validating changes and ensuring that new features do not break existing functionalities in the AI Threat Detection backend.
