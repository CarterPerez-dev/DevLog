## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/core/foundation

## Purpose and Scope

The `CarterOS-Server/src/core/foundation` package serves as the foundational layer of the server application, providing essential utilities for logging and handling HTTP responses. This package is designed to be imported by other modules within the project to ensure consistent behavior across different components.

## File Relationships

1. **__init__.py**:
   - This file acts as a namespace for the package, allowing it to be imported directly.
   
2. **logging.py**:
   - Contains classes and functions for configuring and managing logging throughout the application. It ensures that all logs are consistent in format and level.

3. **responses.py**:
   - Provides utility functions for constructing HTTP responses. These functions help in standardizing how different parts of the server handle response generation, ensuring a clean separation between business logic and response formatting.

## Public API Surface

- **logging**: 
  - `configure_logger()`: Sets up the logging configuration.
  - `get_logger(name)`: Returns a logger instance for a given module name.

- **responses**:
  - `build_response(status_code, body, headers=None)`: Creates an HTTP response object with specified status code, body, and optional headers.

## When to Use

Developers would use this package when they need consistent logging across the application or require standardized methods for constructing HTTP responses. Importing these modules ensures that all parts of the server adhere to a common set of practices, enhancing maintainability and reducing boilerplate code.
