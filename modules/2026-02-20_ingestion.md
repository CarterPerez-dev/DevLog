## Module Overview

# Core Ingestion Module

## Purpose and Scope
The `core/ingestion` package is part of the backend for an advanced AI threat detection system. It handles the core data ingestion processes, ensuring that raw data from various sources can be processed and fed into the machine learning models.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `core/ingestion` package.
- **parsers.py**: Contains classes and functions responsible for parsing different types of input data formats, such as CSV or JSON.
- **pipeline.py**: Manages the overall data ingestion pipeline, integrating parsers with other components to ensure seamless data flow.
- **tailer.py**: Implements a tail-like functionality to continuously monitor and ingest new data from log files or streams.

## Public API Surface
The public API includes:
- `parsers`: A module containing classes for parsing different data formats.
- `pipeline`: Classes and functions for managing the ingestion pipeline, including methods to start and stop the pipeline.
- `tailer`: Functions for tailing log files and streaming new data in real-time.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this module when setting up or modifying the data ingestion process. For instance, they might use parsers to adapt input formats, configure the pipeline for different scenarios, or implement custom tailing logic for specific data sources.
