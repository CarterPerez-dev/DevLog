## Module Overview

# backend/api/websockets

## Purpose and Scope
The `backend/api/websockets` package is designed to manage WebSocket connections for real-time communication in the CertGames-Core application. It encapsulates the logic required to handle WebSocket events, maintain connection states, and facilitate data exchange between the server and clients.

## File Relationships
- **__init__.py**: This file serves as the entry point for the `websockets` package. It imports and initializes key components defined in other files.
- **setup.py**: Handles the packaging and distribution of the WebSocket module, defining metadata such as version, dependencies, and scripts.
- **socket_manager.py**: Contains the core logic for managing WebSocket connections. This includes functions to establish new connections, handle incoming messages, and manage connection states.

## Public API Surface
The public API is primarily exposed through `socket_manager.py`. Key classes and functions include:
- `WebSocketManager`: A class responsible for creating and maintaining WebSocket connections.
- `handle_message`: A function that processes incoming WebSocket messages.
- `start_websocket_server`: A function to start the WebSocket server.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when implementing real-time features in CertGames-Core, such as live updates or multiplayer interactions. By leveraging the `WebSocketManager` and related functions, developers can easily integrate WebSocket functionality into their application logic without managing low-level details directly.
