## Module Overview

# dashboard/frontend/src/pages/repos

## Purpose and Scope
The `repos` module in CodeWorm's frontend project is designed to manage and display repository-related functionalities within the application. This includes listing, filtering, and interacting with repositories.

## File Relationships
- **index.ts**: Serves as an entry point for the `repos` module. It exports the main component defined in `repos.tsx`.
- **repos.tsx**: Contains the React component responsible for rendering repository data and handling user interactions.

## Public API Surface
The public API surface of this module is exposed via `index.ts`, which exports the `Component` from `repos.tsx`. This allows other parts of the application to import and use the repository page component seamlessly.

## When a Developer Would Use This Module
Developers would interact with this package when they need to implement or customize the repository management section of the frontend. This could be during feature development, bug fixing, or enhancing user experience related to repositories in the CodeWorm application.
