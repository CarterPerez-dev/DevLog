## Module Overview

# CarterOS-Server/src/app

## Purpose and Scope

The `CarterOS-Server/src/app` package is designed to manage the core application logic of the server, including initialization, routing, and API documentation. It serves as the central hub for defining how requests are handled and responses are generated.

## File Relationships

1. **__init__.py**: This file initializes the package and sets up any necessary configurations or dependencies.
2. **factory.py**: Handles the creation of application instances, including setting up databases, configurations, and other services required by the application.
3. **openapi.py**: Manages the OpenAPI documentation for the server, ensuring that API specifications are properly defined and available for clients to use.
4. **routers.py**: Contains the routing logic, defining endpoints and their corresponding handlers.

## Public API Surface

- `factory.create_app()`: A public method to instantiate the application with all necessary configurations and services.
- `openapi.spec()`: Returns the OpenAPI specification as a dictionary or JSON string for documentation purposes.

## When to Use This Module

Developers would interact with this package when setting up or modifying the server's core functionalities. Specifically, they would use it during application initialization and API development phases to ensure that all services are properly configured and documented.
